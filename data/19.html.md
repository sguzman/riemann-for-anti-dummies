## The Know is Only a Special Case of the Unknown {#the-know-is-only-a-special-case-of-the-unknown style="text-align: left;"}
:::

On June 10, 1854 Bernhard Riemann presented his now famous Habilitation
Lecture, "On the Hypotheses that lie at the Foundation of Geometry", to
the faculty of Gottingen University. To begin to comprehend Riemann's
revolutionary address, imagine yourself in the audience, looking over
the shoulder of Carl Gauss who had chosen the topic from among three
proposals submitted by his student. Think, if you can, of what Gauss was
thinking as the 28 year old Riemann stated his intention to lift the
darkness concerning the basic assumptions of geometry. "One sees neither
whether and in how far their connection is necessary; nor a priori
whether it is possible."

"From Euclid to Legendre, to name the most renowned of modern writers on
geometry, this darkness has been lifted neither by the mathematicians
nor by the philosophers who have labored upon it. The reason of this
lay, perhaps, in the fact that the general concept of multiply extended
magnitudes, in which spatial magnitudes are comprehended, has not been
elaborated at all. Accordingly, I have proposed to myself at first the
problem of constructing the concept of a multiply extended magnitude out
of a general notions of quantity. From this it will result that a
multiply extended magnitude is susceptible of various metric relations
and that space, accordingly, constitutes only a particular case of a
multiply extended magnitude. A necessary sequel of this is that the
propositions of geometry are not derivable from general concepts of
quantity, but that those properties by which space is distinguished from
other conceivable triply extended magnitudes can be gathered only from
experience. There arises from this the problem of searching out the
simplest facts by which the metric relations of space can be determined,
a problem which in the nature of things is not quite definite; for
several systems of simple facts can be stated which would suffice for
determining the metric relations of space; the most important for
present purposes is that laid down for foundations by Euclid. These
facts are, like all facts, not necessary but of a merely empirical
certainty; they are hypotheses; one may therefore inquire into their
probability, which is a truly very great within the bounds of
observation, and thereafter decide concerning the admissibility of
protracting them outside the limits of observation, not only toward the
immeasurable large, but also toward the immeasurably small."

Riemann's words echoed the thoughts of Gauss, who, more than 60 years
earlier, had been prompted by his teacher, A.G. Kaestner, to reject the
assumption that the characteristics of Euclidean geometry were true.
Gauss responded to Kaestner's provocation by embarking on a life-long
effort to free science from the Aristotelean straight-jacket of a priori
assumptions about physical space. While, it formed the core of his
thinking, and the basis for his discoveries in physical science, Gauss
only published a few "hints" on the subject, to which Riemann referred
in the opening of his lecture.

Nevertheless, Gauss' efforts to develop a "general concept of
multiply-extended magnitudes" were already evident in his earliest
discovery of the division of the circle.(fn.1) There, Gauss showed that
the divisions of the circle that were "constructable", that is formed by
magnitudes commensurable with the diameter of the circle, or its square,
and therefore, "knowable", were only a special case of those divisions
that were based magnitudes that were "unknowable". These "unknowable"
magnitudes were only "unknowable" from the standpoint of the circle
itself . They were not generated by the circle, but by a higher
principle, of which the circle was only a reflection. But, since those
higher principles were not perceivable by the senses, they could only be
"known" by magnitudes that were "unknowable". The "unknown" was no less
real than the "known", but could not be measured by the "known". Instead
of thinking of the "known" as real, and the "unknown" as imaginary,
Gauss, considered the "unknown" primary, and the "known", as only a
special case.

This required the creation of a new set of metaphors, by which we can
represent to the mind, a precise concept of the "unknown", or , as
Riemann would call it, "a general concept of multiply-extended
magnitude", the first hints of which were supplied by Gauss.

The first hint to which Riemann referred was Gauss' "Second Treatise on
Bi-quadratic Residues". While it was not published until 1832, Gauss had
worked out its essential concepts during the period of the writing of
his "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae" and during the early phases of his
investigations in astronomy and geodesy. It may at first seem odd that
concepts concerning the relationships among whole numbers could somehow
be related to discoveries in physics, but that is only because the
accustomed way of thinking these days is so infected with
Aristotelean-Bogomilism. For Gauss, the paradoxes that arise in the mind
when it contemplates itself are necessarily congruent to the paradoxes
that arise in the mind when it investigates the world outside itself.
Take the case of whole numbers. It is obvious that whole numbers do not
arise in the mind from counting things. Rather, as Cusa says in "On
Conjectures":

"The essence of number is therefore the prime exemplar of the mind....
In that we conjecture symbolically from the rational numbers of our mind
in respect to the real ineffable numbers of the Divine Mind, we indeed
say that number is the prime exemplar of things in the mind of the
Composer, just as the number arising from our rationality is the
exemplar of the imaginal world."

Thus, investigations of the relations among numbers will, as Plato says
in the Republic, "Lead the mind from becoming to being." It is from this
standpoint that Gauss developed the means to investigate the
"metaphysics of the theory of space" through the relationships of whole
numbers, a sort of experimental approach to numbers.

In order to grasp this, the reader will have to work through some basic
principles from Gauss' "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae" which will lead
into the relevant sections of "Bi-Quadratic Residues." This will be the
basis for some fun work that will unfold in the next succeeding
installments.
