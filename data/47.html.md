Riemann for Anti-Dummies Part 47

DEFEATING I. KANT

In the opening of his Habilitation lecture, Bernhard Riemann proposed to
establish the foundations of geometry on a rigorous basis:

"Accordingly, I have proposed to myself at first the problem of
constructing the concept of a multiply extended magnitude out of general
notions of quantity. From this it will result that a multiply extended
magnitude is susceptible of various metric relations and that space
accordingly constitutes only a particular case of a triply-extended
magnitude. A necessary sequel to this is that the propositions of
geometry are not derivable from general concepts of quantity, but that
those properties by which space is distinguished from other conceivable
triply-extended magnitudes can be gathered only from experience".

Riemann's program poses a paradox for those habituated to the doctrine
of Immanuel Kant and its more extreme, modern form--existentialism. How
can the propositions of geometry be determined by experience?

Kant had insisted that:

"Space is not an empirical concept which has been derived from outer
experiences. For in order that certain sensations be referred to
something outside me...the representation of space must be presupposed.
The representation of space cannot, therefore, be empirically obtained
from the relations of outer appearance. On the contrary, this outer
experience is itself possible at all only through that
representation."..."Geometry is a science which determines the
properties of space synthetically; and yet a priori. It must in its
origin be intuition; for from a mere concept no propositions can be
obtained which go beyond the concept as happens in geometry. For
geometrical propositions are one and all apodeictic, that is, are bound
up with the consciousness of their necessity; for instance that space
has only three dimensions. Such propositions cannot be empirical or, in
other words, judgments of experience, nor can they be derived from any
such judgments."

Kant was not very original. Nearly two centuries earlier, Johannes
Kepler, through his discovery of universal gravitation, had already
liberated science from similar Aristotelean dogmas that, from the murder
of Archimedes until the Renaissance, had enslaved European civilization.
Kant was deployed to put the chains back on. Those doctrines had taught
that experience, (which, for them, was limited to sense perception), can
tell us nothing about the physical world. For example, our experience of
phenomena such as the motion of the planets and other heavenly bodies,
is limited to the perceptions of the changes of position of points of
light on the inside of a great sphere of unknown radius, whose center is
always the location of the observer. For the Aristoteleans, the actual
motions, as well as the principles that govern them, are inherently
unknowable, and so they must be referred to some a priori determined set
of propositions, such as those of Ptolemy, Copernicus or Brahe. These
propositions, in turn, are ultimately derived from Euclidean-type
axioms, postulates and definitions, which Kant insisted, are the only
possible form by which we can conceive of space:

"Space is a necessary a priori representation, which underlies all outer
intuitions. We can never represent to ourselves the absence of space,
though we can quite well think it as empty of objects. It must therefore
be regarded as the condition of the possibility of appearances, and not
as a determination dependent upon them. It is an a priori
representation, which necessarily underlies outer appearances."

According to Kant: these propositions are not decidedly truthful; they
make no judgement about the actual motions; they are the form by which
the appearances must be represented; and nothing can happen that is not
possible under these propositions.

When you begin to think about this, you come face to face with the
fundamental question of science (and also, politics, history and art):
What is experience? Is it sense perception? Therein lies Kant's
trickery, for if experience is limited to sense perception, then indeed,
it can tell us nothing about the propositions of geometry. As Kant's
sophistry insists: "Were this representation of space a concept acquired
a posteriori, and derived from outer experience in general, the first
principles of mathematical determination would be nothing but
perceptions. They would therefore all share in the contingent character
of perception; that there should be only one straight line between two
points would not be necessary, but only what experience always teaches.
What is derived from experience has only comparative universality,
namely, that which is obtained through induction. We should therefore
only be able to say that, so far as hitherto observed, no space has been
found which has more than three dimensions."

However, Riemann had something far different in mind when he spoke of
experience:

"There arises from this the problem of searching out the simplest facts
by which the metric relations of space can be determined, a problem
which in the nature of things is not quite definite; for several systems
of simple facts can be stated which would suffice for determining the
metric relations of space; the most important for present purposes is
that laid down for foundations by Euclid. These facts are, like all
facts, not necessary but of a merely empirical certainty; they are
hypotheses..."

For Riemann, as for all humans not self-degraded into
Aristotelean/Kantian bestiality, experience is not sense-perception; it
is the active interaction of the mind with the universe, of which it is
a part. It is, as Plato insists, the formation of hypotheses, higher
hypotheses, and hypothesizing the higher hypothesis. It is the
investigator, investigating, how he is investigating what is being
investigated. Or, as for Apollo, who sings in Percy Shelley's Hymn, "I
am the eye with which the Universe beholds itself and knows itself
divine;"

The propositions of geometry can, and must, be derived from this type of
experience and Riemann advanced the general methods for how this is
done. He divides this task into two steps, both of which rested on
foundations laid by Gauss. The first, as indicated above, is the
determination of the general notion of multiply-extended magnitude. Here
Riemann cites Gauss's second treatise on bi-quadratic residues and his
fundamental theorem of algebra. In those works, as well as other
unpublished discussions, Gauss attacked Kant's view as an "illusion,"
and he advanced the concepts begun with the investigations of the
Pythagoreans, Archytas and Plato, that physical action, not a priori
intuition, gives rise to our concept of extension, as exemplified by the
different principles, or powers, of physical action that extend a line,
square, or cube.

In each type of action, the determination of the essential,
distinguishing characteristic, Riemann noted, always leads back to "n"
determinations of magnitude, in which "n" signifies the relative degree
of the power governing the action. For example, a cube, which is
determined by a triply-extended magnitude, cannot be determined by the
doubly-extended square, nor a square by a simply-extended line.

However, there is still another consideration:

" ...there follows as second of the problems proposed above, an
investigation into the relations of measure that such a manifold is
susceptible of, also into the conditions which suffice for determining
these metric relations. These relations of measure can be investigated
only in abstract notions of magnitude and can be exhibited connectedly
only in formulae; upon certain assumptions, however, one is able to
resolve them into relations which are separately capable of being
represented geometrically, and by this means it becomes possible to
express geometrically the results of the calculation. Therefore if one
is to reach solid ground, an abstract investigation in formulae is
indeed unavoidable, but its results will allow an exhibition in the
clothing of geometry. For both parts the foundations are contained in
the celebrated treatise of Privy Councillor Gauss upon curved surfaces."

Thus, the question of discovering a physical geometry requires
determining both the "n" determinations of magnitude, and their measure
relations. Neither of these can be given a priori. How, then, can these
matters be discovered from human cognitive, (as opposed to Kantian)
experience?

The last three installments of this series, (Riemann for Anti-Dummies
Parts 44, 45, and 46), explored the essential foundations of Gauss' and
Riemann's approach. There we showed how Gauss, from his very earliest
work under the tutelage of Kaestner and Zimmerman, recognized that only
physical principles, not definitions, can lay the foundations for
geometry, as, for example, the determination of what is a straight-line.
From there, Gauss showed that these physical principles determine a
characteristic curvature from which the measure relations of a surface
are derived, and that these general principles of curvature are
expressed, in the smallest parts, by the characteristics of the
"shortest lines", or geodesics, of the surface. What remains to discuss
is this discovery's inversion. How can the physical principles of the
curvature of the surface be determined from the characteristics of the
geodesics as measured by small changes in those geodesics?

Gauss' work on this inverse problem is of crucial significance, as this
is the form of investigation usually confronted in science, politics,
history and art. We cannot know these physical principles by sense
perception, but we can perceive their effects by some small measurable
change, from which, by hypothesizing, we can determine the general
principles that are determining that change. Kepler determined the
general principles of curvature of the solar system as a whole, from
small measured changes in the relationship between the orbits of Mars
and Earth. Leibniz and Bernoulli determined the general principles of
least- action from small measured changes in the shape of a hanging
chain. Gauss determined the solar system's harmonic dissonance that had
been indicated by Kepler, from Piazzi's very small measurements of
Ceres' arc. LaRouche determined the general direction of world history
by measured changes in the cultural/mental outlook of the population
following the death of FDR.

As Riemann indicated, an exploration of Gauss' work in this direction is
impossible without resort to abstract concepts expressible by formulae,
but, these results are always capable of geometrical representation. For
pedagogical purposes we will minimize the former and emphasize the
latter, but limited reference to formulae are unavoidable, and will
always be accompanied by the appropriate geometrical representation.

To begin to get a handle on the principles involved, take a simple case
a line. When considered as a simply-extended magnitude, a line can be
increased or decreased only by action along its length, that is, back
and forth. Such changes can be measured only by increments of more or
less, and expressed by rational numbers.

However, when that line is understood to be generated from a
doubly-extended magnitude, such as the diagonal of a square or
rectangle, its increases or decreases are measured by an entirely
different set of relationships, as demonstrated by Plato in the Meno and
Theatetus dialogues. In this case, the line is increased or decreased
along its length, but only in a connected way, to changes in the lengths
of the side of the square or rectangle. These changes cannot be measured
by the simple ideas of more, or less, as expressed by rational numbers.
Rather, they express the type of relationship that has come to be known
by the "Pythagorean theorem", which as Pythagoras and Plato emphasized,
are incommensurable with simply-extended magnitudes.

Draw a rectangle and call the length of one side "x" and the length of
the other side "y". By the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the
diagonal "s" can be measured as the square root of the sum of the
squares of the two sides, or in shorthand, s=?(x ^2^ +y ^2^ ). If the
diagonal is extended by a small amount "ds", the sides of the rectangle
will be increased by proportional small amounts "dx" and "dy". ("ds",
"dx", and, "dy" are Leibniz' notation for these infinitesimal
increments, which he called differentials.) If this action is taking
place on a Euclidean flat plane, then ds, dx and dy, will express the
Pythagorean relationship, ds=?(dx ^2^ +dy ^2^ ).

Thus, contrary to the textbook versions, the Pythagorean relationship is
not an arbitrary formula; it expresses a characteristic relationship of
a certain type of surface--a Euclidean flat plane. Inversely, if a
physical process is measured by the Pythagorean relationship expressed
above, that action is occurring in a Euclidean flat plane.

This measurable physical relationship, not Kant's dictum of a priori
certitude, is the only reality of a Euclidean flat plane. And, since
real world physical measurements express a different relationship, the
physical reality of a Euclidean flat plane is not only not necessary, it
is illusory .

But, if our cognitive experience, i.e. physical measurement, determines
that the Pythagorean relationship doesn't hold, what relationship
expresses a doubly-extended magnitude? A Kantian will fly into a fit of
rage at this paradox. Kant insists that Euclidean space is the only
possible way one can think about space, therefore, for the Kantian,
Euclidean space must be the only space possible. And so, the Kantian
will demand the world be treated as if it were Euclidean, even if
physical measurements tell us otherwise. Fakers in the tradition of
Gallileo's deceitful attempt to curve-fit the catenary into a parabola,
will have no problem with this. They will suggest limiting physical
measurements to small enough regions, that the deviation from the
Pythagorean relationship is below the errors of measurement. Such
chicanery is, however, only self-deception, as the deviation from
flatness, no matter how small it may seem, still exists, and, sooner or
later, judgements made on that delusion will become impossible to ignore
(as, for example, how the ongoing financial crisis was ignored by
believers in such "New Economy" frauds as exemplified by the Winstar
madness).

Gauss, of course, rejected such follies. He recognized that the
Pythagorean relationship, as expressed in Euclidean geometry, was not
sacrosanct. Rather, it was merely a special case of a more general
principle. Rather than cling to the special case, Gauss discovered the
foundations on which more the general principle was based.

To gain an understanding of Gauss' discovery, it is pedagogically
efficient to work through several examples, and then abstract from them
the general principle at work.

Begin with the case of the physically determined celestial sphere. This
surface is physically determined by the position of the observer and the
direction of the pull of gravity. The former determines the center of
the sphere and the latter determines the poles and the horizon. If we
are bound by Kant's constriction that we can only think of space as
infinitely extended in three directions, then this sphere sits like a
large object surrounded by empty space.

But, Gauss was free from Kantianism, and he understood the celestial
sphere as a manifold of physical action, produced by two mutually
inter-dependent angles: the angles around the horizon and the angles
perpendicular to it. (For pedagogical simplicity, I will refer to these
angles by the familiar names latitude and longitude respectively.)

All positions on the celestial sphere can be determined by these two
physical parameters. (Thus, for the sphere, n=2, in Riemann's terms of
"n" determinations of magnitude.) From this relationship, Gauss
constructed what is called a "parametric formula" in which the surface
of the sphere is expressed entirely by these two parameters.

All the longitudinal circles have a common center, i.e. the observer.
Positions along any one of these circles can be determined by a function
of the angle from the horizon to the zenith. If this angle is called
"p", then any position along a circle of longitude can be determined as
a function of the cosine and the sine of the angle "p". [(See Figure
1.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part47_files_part47figure01.gif)
Each of these circles of longitude can be distinguished from one
another, by another angle, as measured around the horizon. If that angle
is called "q", then positions around this circle can be determined as a
function of the cosine and sine of angle "q".

Thus, for all the positions along a single circle of longitude, q is
constant while p varies, whereas for all positions along a single circle
of latitude, p is constant while q varies. However, there is a
significant difference between the two types of circles. The center of
all the circles of longitude are the same as the center of the sphere,
consequently, all circles of longitude are great circles. But, the
circles of latitude all become smaller as they get farther from the
horizon and closer to the poles. How much smaller they get, is function
of angle p, that is, how close they are to the poles. From the geometry
of the sphere, the radii of the circles of latitude are proportional to
the cosine of angle p. [(See figure

From this, all positions on a sphere can be reduced to determinations of
the two parameters p and q, which reflect the physical curvature of the
sphere. (footenote 1.) The empty box, which Kant insisted on, just
disappeared, perhaps into the empty corners of his brain from whence it
came.

Gauss now investigated the relationship between the length of an
arbitrary geodesic of the sphere and the angles p and q, in order to
determine a way of measuring the general principles of curvature of the
surface from small measured changes in the geodesic.

To do this, Gauss established a more general form of the Pythagorean
relationship. In the case of the sphere, a geodesic line can be thought
of as a diagonal of a spherical rectangle, whose sides are circles of
longitude and latitude. But, unlike the Pythagorean in the Euclidean
flat plane, the relationship between the sides of the spherical
rectangles are changing, depending on their position with respect to the
horizon and the poles. Specifically, the latitudinal sides will get
shorter, by a factor proportional to the cosine of angle p, as the
longitudinal sides increase towards the poles. [(See Figure
3.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part47_files_part47figure03.gif)
Thus, the "spherical Pythagorean" must measure not only the relationship
of the diagonal to the sides, but the also the change in this
relationship as the relationship between the sides themselves changes.
From this, Gauss showed, that the form of the "spherical Pythagorean",
is that the length of the geodesic "ds" =?((Cos\[p\]) ^2^ dp ^2^ + dq
^2^ ) where ds is the change in the length of the diagonal and dp and dq
are the changes in longitude and latitude. The coefficient Cos\[p\] ^2^
expresses the shortening of the latitude lines as they get closer to the
poles.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Consequently, if one is making physical measurements along what appears
to be a "straight-line", and the relationship measured corresponds to
this "spherical Pythagorean", then that "straight-line" is a geodesic on
a sphere.

To further develop this idea, continue in this same vein to the two
other examples used in Riemann for Anti-Dummies Part 46, the spheroid
and the ellipsoid.

For the spheroid, a parametric formula can be constructed that expresses
the geometrical relationship that the lines of latitude get shorter as
they approach the poles, while the lines of longitude get longer. [(See
Figure
4.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part47_files_part47figure04.gif)
In this case, the "spheroidal Pythagorean" must express the relationship
between the length of the geodesic, "ds", and the changing relationship
between the lengths of the circles of latitude and the ellipses of
longitude. This produces a somewhat more complicated formula for the
"spheroidal Pythagorean", but its geometrical representation can be
gleaned from the accompanying figure.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

By inversion, if physical measurements along a "straight- line" reflect
the relationship expressed by the "spheroidal Pythagorean", that
"straight-line" must be a geodesic on a spheroid.

On the ellipsoid, as illustrated in the last installment, the
relationship between the sides of the "ellipsoidal rectangles" changes
as they move towards the poles and as they move around in the
latitudinal direction as well. [(See Figure
5.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part47_files_part47figure05.gif)
Using Gauss' method, it is possible to calculate a formula for this
"ellipsoidal Pythagorean", which enables us to make the same type of
determinations about the general principles of curvature from small
changes in the measurement of the "ellipsoidal geodesic".

In his treatise on curved surfaces, cited by Riemann in the habilitation
paper, Gauss developed a general form of the Pythagorean that expressed
the relationship between the geodesic line and the two determinations of
magnitude of that surface. For purely illustrative purposes, the form of
Gauss' generalized Pythagorean is, ds=?E ^2^ dp ^2^ +2Fdpdq+G ^2^ dq ^2^
, where, E, F, and G are themselves functions which express the changing
relationship of the two parameters of the surface. E expresses the
function by which p changes with respect to q; G expresses the function
by which q changes with respect to p; and F expresses the function by
which the area of the rectangle changes relative to changes in p and q.
For the Euclidean flat plane, Gauss' Pythagorean reduces to the familiar
form.

As Riemann indicated, this relationship in its most general form is
expressed by the above formula, but, as in the above examples, its
results can always be represented geometrically.

With this foundation laid by Gauss, Riemann went still further, to
determine an even more general idea of a Pythagorean, not only for
surfaces, but for manifolds of "n" determinations of magnitude. This
leads into even more interesting areas, such as the one confronted in
investigating physical processes in the very small and very large, or,
in the biotic domain, where the characteristic of the geodesic is
changing non-uniformly. To reach that point we must, however, first
master the foundations laid by Gauss and Riemann, with some assistance
of the insights gained from classical art, such as Beethoven's late
string quartets.

Riemann for Anti-Dummies Part 47

DEFEATING I. KANT

In the opening of his Habilitation lecture, Bernhard Riemann proposed to
establish the foundations of geometry on a rigorous basis:

"Accordingly, I have proposed to myself at first the problem of
constructing the concept of a multiply extended magnitude out of general
notions of quantity. From this it will result that a multiply extended
magnitude is susceptible of various metric relations and that space
accordingly constitutes only a particular case of a triply-extended
magnitude. A necessary sequel to this is that the propositions of
geometry are not derivable from general concepts of quantity, but that
those properties by which space is distinguished from other conceivable
triply-extended magnitudes can be gathered only from experience".

Riemann's program poses a paradox for those habituated to the doctrine
of Immanuel Kant and its more extreme, modern form--existentialism. How
can the propositions of geometry be determined by experience?

Kant had insisted that:

"Space is not an empirical concept which has been derived from outer
experiences. For in order that certain sensations be referred to
something outside me...the representation of space must be presupposed.
The representation of space cannot, therefore, be empirically obtained
from the relations of outer appearance. On the contrary, this outer
experience is itself possible at all only through that
representation."..."Geometry is a science which determines the
properties of space synthetically; and yet a priori. It must in its
origin be intuition; for from a mere concept no propositions can be
obtained which go beyond the concept as happens in geometry. For
geometrical propositions are one and all apodeictic, that is, are bound
up with the consciousness of their necessity; for instance that space
has only three dimensions. Such propositions cannot be empirical or, in
other words, judgments of experience, nor can they be derived from any
such judgments."

Kant was not very original. Nearly two centuries earlier, Johannes
Kepler, through his discovery of universal gravitation, had already
liberated science from similar Aristotelean dogmas that, from the murder
of Archimedes until the Renaissance, had enslaved European civilization.
Kant was deployed to put the chains back on. Those doctrines had taught
that experience, (which, for them, was limited to sense perception), can
tell us nothing about the physical world. For example, our experience of
phenomena such as the motion of the planets and other heavenly bodies,
is limited to the perceptions of the changes of position of points of
light on the inside of a great sphere of unknown radius, whose center is
always the location of the observer. For the Aristoteleans, the actual
motions, as well as the principles that govern them, are inherently
unknowable, and so they must be referred to some a priori determined set
of propositions, such as those of Ptolemy, Copernicus or Brahe. These
propositions, in turn, are ultimately derived from Euclidean-type
axioms, postulates and definitions, which Kant insisted, are the only
possible form by which we can conceive of space:

"Space is a necessary a priori representation, which underlies all outer
intuitions. We can never represent to ourselves the absence of space,
though we can quite well think it as empty of objects. It must therefore
be regarded as the condition of the possibility of appearances, and not
as a determination dependent upon them. It is an a priori
representation, which necessarily underlies outer appearances."

According to Kant: these propositions are not decidedly truthful; they
make no judgement about the actual motions; they are the form by which
the appearances must be represented; and nothing can happen that is not
possible under these propositions.

When you begin to think about this, you come face to face with the
fundamental question of science (and also, politics, history and art):
What is experience? Is it sense perception? Therein lies Kant's
trickery, for if experience is limited to sense perception, then indeed,
it can tell us nothing about the propositions of geometry. As Kant's
sophistry insists: "Were this representation of space a concept acquired
a posteriori, and derived from outer experience in general, the first
principles of mathematical determination would be nothing but
perceptions. They would therefore all share in the contingent character
of perception; that there should be only one straight line between two
points would not be necessary, but only what experience always teaches.
What is derived from experience has only comparative universality,
namely, that which is obtained through induction. We should therefore
only be able to say that, so far as hitherto observed, no space has been
found which has more than three dimensions."

However, Riemann had something far different in mind when he spoke of
experience:

"There arises from this the problem of searching out the simplest facts
by which the metric relations of space can be determined, a problem
which in the nature of things is not quite definite; for several systems
of simple facts can be stated which would suffice for determining the
metric relations of space; the most important for present purposes is
that laid down for foundations by Euclid. These facts are, like all
facts, not necessary but of a merely empirical certainty; they are
hypotheses..."

For Riemann, as for all humans not self-degraded into
Aristotelean/Kantian bestiality, experience is not sense-perception; it
is the active interaction of the mind with the universe, of which it is
a part. It is, as Plato insists, the formation of hypotheses, higher
hypotheses, and hypothesizing the higher hypothesis. It is the
investigator, investigating, how he is investigating what is being
investigated. Or, as for Apollo, who sings in Percy Shelley's Hymn, "I
am the eye with which the Universe beholds itself and knows itself
divine;"

The propositions of geometry can, and must, be derived from this type of
experience and Riemann advanced the general methods for how this is
done. He divides this task into two steps, both of which rested on
foundations laid by Gauss. The first, as indicated above, is the
determination of the general notion of multiply-extended magnitude. Here
Riemann cites Gauss's second treatise on bi-quadratic residues and his
fundamental theorem of algebra. In those works, as well as other
unpublished discussions, Gauss attacked Kant's view as an "illusion,"
and he advanced the concepts begun with the investigations of the
Pythagoreans, Archytas and Plato, that physical action, not a priori
intuition, gives rise to our concept of extension, as exemplified by the
different principles, or powers, of physical action that extend a line,
square, or cube.

In each type of action, the determination of the essential,
distinguishing characteristic, Riemann noted, always leads back to "n"
determinations of magnitude, in which "n" signifies the relative degree
of the power governing the action. For example, a cube, which is
determined by a triply-extended magnitude, cannot be determined by the
doubly-extended square, nor a square by a simply-extended line.

However, there is still another consideration:

" ...there follows as second of the problems proposed above, an
investigation into the relations of measure that such a manifold is
susceptible of, also into the conditions which suffice for determining
these metric relations. These relations of measure can be investigated
only in abstract notions of magnitude and can be exhibited connectedly
only in formulae; upon certain assumptions, however, one is able to
resolve them into relations which are separately capable of being
represented geometrically, and by this means it becomes possible to
express geometrically the results of the calculation. Therefore if one
is to reach solid ground, an abstract investigation in formulae is
indeed unavoidable, but its results will allow an exhibition in the
clothing of geometry. For both parts the foundations are contained in
the celebrated treatise of Privy Councillor Gauss upon curved surfaces."

Thus, the question of discovering a physical geometry requires
determining both the "n" determinations of magnitude, and their measure
relations. Neither of these can be given a priori. How, then, can these
matters be discovered from human cognitive, (as opposed to Kantian)
experience?

The last three installments of this series, (Riemann for Anti-Dummies
Parts 44, 45, and 46), explored the essential foundations of Gauss' and
Riemann's approach. There we showed how Gauss, from his very earliest
work under the tutelage of Kaestner and Zimmerman, recognized that only
physical principles, not definitions, can lay the foundations for
geometry, as, for example, the determination of what is a straight-line.
From there, Gauss showed that these physical principles determine a
characteristic curvature from which the measure relations of a surface
are derived, and that these general principles of curvature are
expressed, in the smallest parts, by the characteristics of the
"shortest lines", or geodesics, of the surface. What remains to discuss
is this discovery's inversion. How can the physical principles of the
curvature of the surface be determined from the characteristics of the
geodesics as measured by small changes in those geodesics?

Gauss' work on this inverse problem is of crucial significance, as this
is the form of investigation usually confronted in science, politics,
history and art. We cannot know these physical principles by sense
perception, but we can perceive their effects by some small measurable
change, from which, by hypothesizing, we can determine the general
principles that are determining that change. Kepler determined the
general principles of curvature of the solar system as a whole, from
small measured changes in the relationship between the orbits of Mars
and Earth. Leibniz and Bernoulli determined the general principles of
least- action from small measured changes in the shape of a hanging
chain. Gauss determined the solar system's harmonic dissonance that had
been indicated by Kepler, from Piazzi's very small measurements of
Ceres' arc. LaRouche determined the general direction of world history
by measured changes in the cultural/mental outlook of the population
following the death of FDR.

As Riemann indicated, an exploration of Gauss' work in this direction is
impossible without resort to abstract concepts expressible by formulae,
but, these results are always capable of geometrical representation. For
pedagogical purposes we will minimize the former and emphasize the
latter, but limited reference to formulae are unavoidable, and will
always be accompanied by the appropriate geometrical representation.

To begin to get a handle on the principles involved, take a simple case
a line. When considered as a simply-extended magnitude, a line can be
increased or decreased only by action along its length, that is, back
and forth. Such changes can be measured only by increments of more or
less, and expressed by rational numbers.

However, when that line is understood to be generated from a
doubly-extended magnitude, such as the diagonal of a square or
rectangle, its increases or decreases are measured by an entirely
different set of relationships, as demonstrated by Plato in the Meno and
Theatetus dialogues. In this case, the line is increased or decreased
along its length, but only in a connected way, to changes in the lengths
of the side of the square or rectangle. These changes cannot be measured
by the simple ideas of more, or less, as expressed by rational numbers.
Rather, they express the type of relationship that has come to be known
by the "Pythagorean theorem", which as Pythagoras and Plato emphasized,
are incommensurable with simply-extended magnitudes.

Draw a rectangle and call the length of one side "x" and the length of
the other side "y". By the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the
diagonal "s" can be measured as the square root of the sum of the
squares of the two sides, or in shorthand, s=?(x ^2^ +y ^2^ ). If the
diagonal is extended by a small amount "ds", the sides of the rectangle
will be increased by proportional small amounts "dx" and "dy". ("ds",
"dx", and, "dy" are Leibniz' notation for these infinitesimal
increments, which he called differentials.) If this action is taking
place on a Euclidean flat plane, then ds, dx and dy, will express the
Pythagorean relationship, ds=?(dx ^2^ +dy ^2^ ).

Thus, contrary to the textbook versions, the Pythagorean relationship is
not an arbitrary formula; it expresses a characteristic relationship of
a certain type of surface--a Euclidean flat plane. Inversely, if a
physical process is measured by the Pythagorean relationship expressed
above, that action is occurring in a Euclidean flat plane.

This measurable physical relationship, not Kant's dictum of a priori
certitude, is the only reality of a Euclidean flat plane. And, since
real world physical measurements express a different relationship, the
physical reality of a Euclidean flat plane is not only not necessary, it
is illusory .

But, if our cognitive experience, i.e. physical measurement, determines
that the Pythagorean relationship doesn't hold, what relationship
expresses a doubly-extended magnitude? A Kantian will fly into a fit of
rage at this paradox. Kant insists that Euclidean space is the only
possible way one can think about space, therefore, for the Kantian,
Euclidean space must be the only space possible. And so, the Kantian
will demand the world be treated as if it were Euclidean, even if
physical measurements tell us otherwise. Fakers in the tradition of
Gallileo's deceitful attempt to curve-fit the catenary into a parabola,
will have no problem with this. They will suggest limiting physical
measurements to small enough regions, that the deviation from the
Pythagorean relationship is below the errors of measurement. Such
chicanery is, however, only self-deception, as the deviation from
flatness, no matter how small it may seem, still exists, and, sooner or
later, judgements made on that delusion will become impossible to ignore
(as, for example, how the ongoing financial crisis was ignored by
believers in such "New Economy" frauds as exemplified by the Winstar
madness).

Gauss, of course, rejected such follies. He recognized that the
Pythagorean relationship, as expressed in Euclidean geometry, was not
sacrosanct. Rather, it was merely a special case of a more general
principle. Rather than cling to the special case, Gauss discovered the
foundations on which more the general principle was based.

To gain an understanding of Gauss' discovery, it is pedagogically
efficient to work through several examples, and then abstract from them
the general principle at work.

Begin with the case of the physically determined celestial sphere. This
surface is physically determined by the position of the observer and the
direction of the pull of gravity. The former determines the center of
the sphere and the latter determines the poles and the horizon. If we
are bound by Kant's constriction that we can only think of space as
infinitely extended in three directions, then this sphere sits like a
large object surrounded by empty space.

But, Gauss was free from Kantianism, and he understood the celestial
sphere as a manifold of physical action, produced by two mutually
inter-dependent angles: the angles around the horizon and the angles
perpendicular to it. (For pedagogical simplicity, I will refer to these
angles by the familiar names latitude and longitude respectively.)

All positions on the celestial sphere can be determined by these two
physical parameters. (Thus, for the sphere, n=2, in Riemann's terms of
"n" determinations of magnitude.) From this relationship, Gauss
constructed what is called a "parametric formula" in which the surface
of the sphere is expressed entirely by these two parameters.

All the longitudinal circles have a common center, i.e. the observer.
Positions along any one of these circles can be determined by a function
of the angle from the horizon to the zenith. If this angle is called
"p", then any position along a circle of longitude can be determined as
a function of the cosine and the sine of the angle "p". [(See Figure
1.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part47_files_part47figure01.gif)
Each of these circles of longitude can be distinguished from one
another, by another angle, as measured around the horizon. If that angle
is called "q", then positions around this circle can be determined as a
function of the cosine and sine of angle "q".

Thus, for all the positions along a single circle of longitude, q is
constant while p varies, whereas for all positions along a single circle
of latitude, p is constant while q varies. However, there is a
significant difference between the two types of circles. The center of
all the circles of longitude are the same as the center of the sphere,
consequently, all circles of longitude are great circles. But, the
circles of latitude all become smaller as they get farther from the
horizon and closer to the poles. How much smaller they get, is function
of angle p, that is, how close they are to the poles. From the geometry
of the sphere, the radii of the circles of latitude are proportional to
the cosine of angle p. [(See figure

From this, all positions on a sphere can be reduced to determinations of
the two parameters p and q, which reflect the physical curvature of the
sphere. (footenote 1.) The empty box, which Kant insisted on, just
disappeared, perhaps into the empty corners of his brain from whence it
came.

Gauss now investigated the relationship between the length of an
arbitrary geodesic of the sphere and the angles p and q, in order to
determine a way of measuring the general principles of curvature of the
surface from small measured changes in the geodesic.

To do this, Gauss established a more general form of the Pythagorean
relationship. In the case of the sphere, a geodesic line can be thought
of as a diagonal of a spherical rectangle, whose sides are circles of
longitude and latitude. But, unlike the Pythagorean in the Euclidean
flat plane, the relationship between the sides of the spherical
rectangles are changing, depending on their position with respect to the
horizon and the poles. Specifically, the latitudinal sides will get
shorter, by a factor proportional to the cosine of angle p, as the
longitudinal sides increase towards the poles. [(See Figure
3.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part47_files_part47figure03.gif)
Thus, the "spherical Pythagorean" must measure not only the relationship
of the diagonal to the sides, but the also the change in this
relationship as the relationship between the sides themselves changes.
From this, Gauss showed, that the form of the "spherical Pythagorean",
is that the length of the geodesic "ds" =?((Cos\[p\]) ^2^ dp ^2^ + dq
^2^ ) where ds is the change in the length of the diagonal and dp and dq
are the changes in longitude and latitude. The coefficient Cos\[p\] ^2^
expresses the shortening of the latitude lines as they get closer to the
poles.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Consequently, if one is making physical measurements along what appears
to be a "straight-line", and the relationship measured corresponds to
this "spherical Pythagorean", then that "straight-line" is a geodesic on
a sphere.

To further develop this idea, continue in this same vein to the two
other examples used in Riemann for Anti-Dummies Part 46, the spheroid
and the ellipsoid.

For the spheroid, a parametric formula can be constructed that expresses
the geometrical relationship that the lines of latitude get shorter as
they approach the poles, while the lines of longitude get longer. [(See
Figure
4.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part47_files_part47figure04.gif)
In this case, the "spheroidal Pythagorean" must express the relationship
between the length of the geodesic, "ds", and the changing relationship
between the lengths of the circles of latitude and the ellipses of
longitude. This produces a somewhat more complicated formula for the
"spheroidal Pythagorean", but its geometrical representation can be
gleaned from the accompanying figure.

By inversion, if physical measurements along a "straight- line" reflect
the relationship expressed by the "spheroidal Pythagorean", that
"straight-line" must be a geodesic on a spheroid.

On the ellipsoid, as illustrated in the last installment, the
relationship between the sides of the "ellipsoidal rectangles" changes
as they move towards the poles and as they move around in the
latitudinal direction as well. [(See Figure
5.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part47_files_part47figure05.gif)
Using Gauss' method, it is possible to calculate a formula for this
"ellipsoidal Pythagorean", which enables us to make the same type of
determinations about the general principles of curvature from small
changes in the measurement of the "ellipsoidal geodesic".

In his treatise on curved surfaces, cited by Riemann in the habilitation
paper, Gauss developed a general form of the Pythagorean that expressed
the relationship between the geodesic line and the two determinations of
magnitude of that surface. For purely illustrative purposes, the form of
Gauss' generalized Pythagorean is, ds=?E ^2^ dp ^2^ +2Fdpdq+G ^2^ dq ^2^
, where, E, F, and G are themselves functions which express the changing
relationship of the two parameters of the surface. E expresses the
function by which p changes with respect to q; G expresses the function
by which q changes with respect to p; and F expresses the function by
which the area of the rectangle changes relative to changes in p and q.
For the Euclidean flat plane, Gauss' Pythagorean reduces to the familiar
form.

As Riemann indicated, this relationship in its most general form is
expressed by the above formula, but, as in the above examples, its
results can always be represented geometrically.

With this foundation laid by Gauss, Riemann went still further, to
determine an even more general idea of a Pythagorean, not only for
surfaces, but for manifolds of "n" determinations of magnitude. This
leads into even more interesting areas, such as the one confronted in
investigating physical processes in the very small and very large, or,
in the biotic domain, where the characteristic of the geodesic is
changing non-uniformly. To reach that point we must, however, first
master the foundations laid by Gauss and Riemann, with some assistance
of the insights gained from classical art, such as Beethoven's late
string quartets.

Cos\[q\] Cos\[p\], Sin\[q\]Cos\[p\], Sin\[p\]. For the spheroid and
ellipsoid, each direction is multiplied by a simple factor.
