Riemann for Anti-Dummies Part 51

THE POWER OF NUMBER

Nicholas of Cusa begins "On Learned Ignorance", by reaching back to the
method of Pythagoras:

"Therefore, every inquiry proceeds through proportion, whether an easy
or difficult one. Hence, the infinite qua infinite, is unknown; for it
escapes all proportion. But since proportion indicates an agreement in
some one respect and, at the same time, indicates an otherness, it
cannot be understood independently of number. Accordingly, number
encompasses all things related proportionally. Therefore, number, which
is a necessary condition of proportion, is present not only in quantity
but also in all things which in any manner whatsoever can agree or
differ either substantially or accidentally. Perhaps for this reason
Pythagoras deemed all things to be constituted and understood through
the power of numbers."

Here, Cusa adopts the view of Plato, that numbers arise from the
inseparable interaction between the human mind and the physical
universe. The mind expresses the concepts it creates, about the
principles it discovers, through the power of numbers. These concepts
themselves become objects of the mind's investigation, and the
relationships among these "thought-objects", also give rise to concepts,
which are themselves expressible through the power of number.

Numbers in and of themselves have no power. They are like ironies that
point, by inversion, to the principles that govern the physical
universe. Those principles don't exist in the numbers. They exist
"behind" the numbers. Thus, the significance of Cusa's reference that
the Pythagoreans deemed all things to be {constituted and understood}
through the power of numbers.

Against Cusa's understanding of Pythagoras is the far different fraud
perpetrated by the Sophists who, then and now, insist on separating the
conjoined idea {constituted and understood}. For them, as for Aristotle,
how things are {constituted}, and how things are {understood}, are two
separate and mutually exclusive actions. In his "Metaphysics", Aristotle
attacks both Plato and the Pythagoreans for their insistence that ideas
are an active principle in the Universe:

"But the lauded characteristics of numbers, and the contraries of these,
and generally the mathematical relations, as some describe them, making
them causes of nature, seem, when we inspect them in this way, to
vanish; for none of them is a cause in any of the senses that have been
distinguished in reference to the first principles. In a sense, however,
they make it plain that goodness belongs to numbers, and that the odd,
the straight, the square, the potencies of certain numbers, are in the
column of the beautiful. For the seasons and a particular kind of number
go together; and the other agreements that they collect from the
theorems of mathematics all have this meaning. Hence they are like
coincidences. For they are accidents..."

Aristotle's method is pure sophistry. As Cusa and Plato both indicate,
number arises in the {human} mind through the effort to discover the
unseen universal principles that govern the world behind the senses.
Thus, the power of numbers is {deliberate}, not accidental. However,
Aristotle plays the trick of separating the world of mind and the world
of matter, and so, for him, any connection between number and the
physical world is purely accidental.

But Aristotle does not have clean hands. He is the hired-gun who
provides the oligarchy with the method it needs, to create the cultural
basis it requires, to assume its arbitrary authority over humanity. By
introducing this false separation between the universe of sensible
things, the unseen principles that govern them, and the thoughts by
which we understand those principles, Aristotle excises human cognition
as an active principle from the Universe. Once cleansed of cognition, he
creates a false universe, indifferent to the power of human thought,
unknowable, and governed by mysterious forces accessible only to those
with access to special incantations, such as the moans of the oracles of
ancient Delphi, or the formulas of formal mathematics.

That is the form of sophistry from which Cusa rescued civilization.

This is not an arcane technical argument, but one that goes to the heart
of the difference between man and beast.

As Cusa stated this explicitly in "On Conjectures":

"The natural sprouting origin of the rational art is number; indeed,
beings which possess no intellect, such as animals, do not count. Number
is nothing other than unfolded rationality...

"...we conjecture symbolically from the rational numbers of our mind in
respect to the real ineffable numbers of the divine Mind, we indeed say
that number is the prime exemplar of things in the mind of the Composer,
just as the number arising from our rationality is the exemplar of the
imaginal world."

Cusa's view was later adopted by Leibniz, who wrote in "Reflections on
the Souls of Beasts":

"However, lest we seem to equate man and beast too closely, it should be
known that there is an enormous difference between the perception of
humans and beasts. For besides the lowest degree of perception that is
found even in insensible creatures, and (as been explained) a middle
degree which we call sensation and acknowledge in beasts, there is a
certain higher degree which we call thought. But thought is perception
joined with reason, which beasts so far as we can observe do not have.

"...However, a human being, insofar as he does not act empirically but
rationally, does not rely solely on experience, or a posteriori
inductions from particular cases, but proceeds a priori on the basis of
reasons. And this is the difference between a geometer, or one trained
in analysis, and an ordinary user of arithmetic, teaching children, who
learn arithmetical rules by rote, but do not know the reason for them,
and consequently cannot decide questions that depart from what they are
used to: such is the difference between the empirical and the rational,
between the inferences of beasts and the reasoning of human
beings....Thus, brutes (as far as we can observe) do not acquire
knowledge of the universality of propositions, because they do not
understand the ground of necessity. And even if empirics are sometimes
led by inductions to universally true propositions, this nonetheless
happens only accidentally, not by force of entailment."

Creating Number

This concept of number is what Gauss had in mind when, provoked by the
paradoxes associated with the "Kepler Problem", he sought the discovery
of those hitherto unknown higher transcendentals indicated by Kepler's
discovery. Gauss recognized, in the tradition of the Pythagoreans,
Plato, Cusa and Leibniz, that these new numbers, like all numbers,
cannot be defined by any set of formal, deductive rules, such as in the
methods of Aristotle, or his philosophical protege, the Leibniz-hating
Euler. Rather, Gauss understood that these new transcendentals, like all
numbers, could only by defined by {inversion} with respect to a physical
process.

To illustrate this point, take a case you think you are familiar with,
and look at it, as Gauss did, from an entirely new standpoint: the
number associated with the relationship of two squares whose areas are
in the proportion 1:2, which is sometimes called, "the square root of
two".

Construct a square from a circle. Now construct a square whose area is
double. How do you know the areas of these two squares are in the
proportion 1:2? Not by looking at them. There is nothing in the visible
appearance of the two squares from which you can {know} the proportion
of their areas. You can know this only from the method of construction,
as Plato discusses that method in the Meno dialogue.

Now, look at the diagonal and the side of the square. These look the
same. Both are lines. There is nothing in the visible appearance of
these lines from which you can {know} their proportion, other than to
say one is a little longer than the other. Yet, the Pythagoreans
{proved} that the two lines are {incommensurable}, or in other words,
had no common measure. This incommensurability cannot be demonstrated
from the visible appearance of the lines, but, only, as the Pythagoreans
did, by investigating the relationship itself between magnitudes that
are commensurable in length and those commensurable as squares. The
Pythagoreans showed that no linear proportion could possibly exist,
whose square is in the proportion 1:2. (See Jason Ross article Fall 2003
21st Century.).

Most importantly, this characteristic of incommensurability is
independent of the actual size of the squares. It depends only on the
proportion between their areas, which is determined only by
construction. As such, this incommensurability expresses a
characteristic of the physical process of the construction of the
squares. Consequently, the number called "the square root of 2", cannot
be defined by any set of rules, definitions or procedures such as a
logical deductive method, but only by an inversion, as {that which
expresses the principle with the power to generate two squares whose
areas are in the proportion 1:2}.

In the visible domain, we proceeded in the opposite manner. We
constructed the squares and produced the magnitude called, "the square
root of two". But from the standpoint of physical principles, it is the
incommensurability of the magnitude called the square root of two which
expresses the {power} (possibility) to produce two squares whose areas
are in the proportion 1:2.

As Thales, Pythagoras, Theodorus, and Theatetus, further demonstrated,
the square root of two is merely a special case of a more general
species of relationships generated from circular action, which they
called one geometric mean between two extremes. [(See Figure
1.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part51_files_part51figure01.gif)
As point P moves from A to O, the length of the line QP will always be
the geometric mean between the lengths of line OQ and QA. When OQ is one
half of QA, then QP is the magnitude called "the square root of 2".

The particular proportion is independent of the size of the circle or
the actual lengths of the lines. It depends solely on the position of P
with respect to A and O, the which is determined by the circular "orbit"
on which P travels. Thus, the circular "orbit" on which P travels
produces, as a whole, a complete "type" or "species" of proportions,
with respect to the magnitudes OQ, QP and QA.

This is one of the simplest examples of the Greek method of the geometry
of position ("topos") known today by the Latin word, "loci", in which
proportions are understood as generated from some physical action.

Another famous example of this method of loci is Archytas's construction
of cubic magnitudes. Here, an entirely new species of magnitudes is
generated by combining two degrees of circular rotation orthogonal to
each other, producing the torus and cylinder whose intersection defines
a different "orbit" on which P travels. Again, these relationships are
dependant only on the characteristic of the "orbit", not on the size of
the circles, or the surfaces generated from them.

The solid loci, or conics, of Menaechmus and Apollonius, follows the
same principle, of generating both square and cubic magnitudes from
{action acting on action}.

But here we seem to have run into a boundary. The change in the motion
that generates one mean between two extremes (squares) to the motion
that generates two means (cubes), was effected by introducing a second
degree of circular action acting orthogonally to the first. Visible
space, however, does not permit the addition of a third degree of
circular action acting orthogonally to these two. Does that mean that no
higher powers are possible? And, if they are possible, how are they
manifest physically, as distinct from some formal mathematical algebraic
definition?

Ultimately, it was Leibniz's discovery of the catenary principle that
demonstrated the physical existence of these higher powers. But that
discovery rested on a previous one by Cusa, which is necessary to review
for the sake of the subject matter to follow.

Look again at the generation of geometric means from circular action,
but this time from the standpoint of inversion. As was demonstrated
above, the circular "orbit" of P generates the entire species of
geometric means. But what about the inverse? Can the entire species of
geometric means produce a circle?

Cusa demonstrated that the answer was no, that, in fact, there exists a
higher principle that generates the circle, which Leibniz later called,
"transcendental". These "circular transcendentals" are identified with
those interrelated magnitudes known as trigonometric functions, and the
relationships among them express the incommensurability between the
curved and the straight. [(See Figure
2.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part51_files_part51figure02.gif)

As Cusa showed, this incommensurability between the curved and the
straight, is a different type than the incommensurability expressed by
squares or cubes, and, the higher "algebraic" powers. Later, Leibniz,
through his discovery of the catenary principle and its relationship to
natural logarithms, demonstrated that all species of algebraic powers
are generated by these transcendental functions, and it is these
transcendental magnitudes, not the algebraic, that express the
relationships that arise in the physical universe.

It is crucial to restate this point in this form:{ The transcendental
functions, not the algebraic, are those functions that are inverse to
circular rotation}. The significance of this statement will become more
clear from the standpoint of the discovery of the higher, elliptical
functions, by Gauss and Riemann.

Elliptical Functions From Kepler to Leibniz

Through his education by E.A.W. Zimmerman and A.G. Kaestner, both
leading defenders of Leibniz and Kepler, Gauss was focused, from his
early adolescence, to investigate the implications of the paradoxes
arising from the "Kepler Problem" that were left unresolved by Leibniz's
invention of the infinitesimal calculus. (See Riemann for Anti-Dummies,
Part 49, Aug. 16, 2003.)

As Kepler demonstrated, the ellipticity of a planetary orbit demanded a
new type of geometry of position, one that expressed the position of the
planet as a function of the characteristic of change of the orbit as a
whole. Kepler's effort to develop this concept resulted in his famous
principle of equal areas. He recognized that in every interval of an
elliptical orbit, no matter how small, the motion of the planet at the
beginning of that interval is different than at the end. The only
interval excepted is one entire orbital period. In that case, the planet
is doing the same thing at the beginning and end of the interval. Thus,
Kepler made the entire orbit the primary interval of action, and
measured the planet's intermediate motion as portions of the whole
orbit.

In The New Astronomy, Kepler, citing Archimedes, measures this
relationship by the proportion of the total area of the planet's orbit,
to the area swept out in a given interval. He defines the area swept out
by the planet as the "sum" of the infinite number of radial distances:

{"For the whole sum of the radial distances is, to the whole periodic
time, as any partial sum of the distances is to its corresponding
time."}

For Kepler, the planet's motion was thus measured by the changing
proportion between the part of the orbit and the whole. This proportion,
Kepler understood to be the "time-elapsed" within any given interval.

It is extremely important to recognize the difference between Kepler's
actual principle and the Newtonian-algebraic formulation, misidentified
as "Kepler's second-law", and stated in text-book gossip circles as:
"the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times". This historically
and epistemologically false characterization is a clinical example of an
Aristotlean-type sophistry in two important ways. First, it falsely
characterizes Kepler's discovered principle as a mathematical "law",
thereby excising out the cognitive action. Second, by stating this law
in the form of a proportion between area and time, it transforms time
and space, by fiat definition, into independent absolute magnitudes. In
this way, the Universe is turned on its head. Instead of recognizing the
characteristics of space and time as functions of the physical motion of
the planet, the fantasy pseudo-world of absolute time and space is held
to define the planet's motion.

Responding to Kepler's demand for a generalization of his principle,
Leibniz developed the infinitesimal calculus, by extending Kepler's
proportionality between the part and the whole, into infinitesimal
intervals of action.

For Leibniz, the infinitesimal is physically determined as a
proportionality, as Cusa understood proportionality, between the
inseparable part and whole of a physical process. His critics reacted by
reaching back to the ancient sophistries of the Eleatics, and, like
Zeno, posed the paradoxes of physical motion from the standpoint of an
arbitrary formal mathematical definition of a curve. Leibniz defended
himself from these attacks during his lifetime, but after his death, the
oligarchy recruited Euler to give a more "academic" imprimatur to these
attacks, as expressed most blatantly in his Letters to a German
Princess.

In response to Euler, Leibniz was posthumously defended, on precisely
this point, by those who were fighting to establish the American
Republic against the oligarchy that employed Euler, most notably by A.G.
Kaestner. (See Appended essay by Kaestner, Moral from the History of the
Infinitesimal Calculus.)

Elliptical Functions of Gauss

Ironically, while Leibniz's discovery of the catenary principle
demonstrated the power of his infinitesimal calculus, its application to
the elliptical orbit, the problem that had provoked its invention, led
to the paradox known as the "Kepler Problem". The essential
characteristics of this paradox can be understood by investigating the
difference between a circular orbit and an elliptical one from the
standpoint of Kepler and Leibniz.

In a circular orbit the area swept out can be measured directly by the
angle. In the elliptical orbit, as Kepler showed, the area swept out is
measured by a circular sector and a rectilinear triangle. [(See Figures
3)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part51_files_part51figure03.gif)

Gauss recognized that this paradox arose from the effort to measure the
elliptical action of the planet by circular functions. The problem here
was that while the circular functions reflect the incommensurability
between the arc and the line, in elliptical action there exists an
incommensurability between the arc and the angle as well. [(See Figure
5.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part51_files_part51figure05.gif)
Gauss realized that since these two types of incommensurability were
connected, both arising from a unified elliptical action, there must
exist a new, more general type of elliptical transcendental, of which
the circular functions were only a special case. The complex domain was
required to make intelligible the relationships associated with these
new transcendentals.

This investigation forms the core of Gauss's youthful work, as a review
of his early notebooks and correspondence reveals. Gauss presented some
aspects of these discoveries more formally in his 1799 new proof of the
Fundamental Theorem of Algebra and his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, as
well as his later works in astronomy, geodesy, and curvature. But
because of the tyranny imposed on Europe in the post-1789 reaction to
the American Revolution, (especially after the 1799 consolidation of
Napoleon's rise to power and its aftermath) some of these discoveries
were never published, and only found their expression in the work of the
next generation of scientists, most notably, Dirichlet, Riemann, Abel,
and Jacobi, who were themselves influenced by Gauss, and the Leibnizian
networks with which Kaestner was associated, such as the Humboldts,
Schiller, Herbart et al.

Because of this fragmentary nature of Gauss's early writings, much of
Gauss's thinking is expressed in abbreviated form. It becomes
pedagogically much easier, therefore, to present the nature of his
discovery, from the standpoint of his later work on curvature and
Riemann's elaboration of those ideas, most notably, in his famous
treatise on Abelian functions. As in Gauss's 1799 proof of the
fundamental theorem of algebra, both Gauss and Riemann indicated the
superiority of geometrical construction to algebraic formulas for
conveying ideas.

The crux of Gauss's method was that of the ancient Greeks, Cusa, Kepler
and Leibniz: that nothing could be known from the visible manifestation
of the circle or the ellipse. Rather, these visible characteristics,
such as the uniformity or non-uniformity of the arcs, were a function of
some underlying principle. That principle, however, was not visible, and
could only be discovered by inversion. In other words, those principles
could not be seen, but could be known, as, that which produces the
visible characteristics of curvature.

To illustrate Gauss' inverse method geometrically, take a new look at
the trigonometric relationships. In the visible domain, the
trigonometric relationships are generated as an effect of circular
motion. But, as Cusa indicated (for which Kepler called him "divine"),
the harmonic characteristics are found not in circular action alone, but
in the incommensurability between the curved and the straight. Thus,
Gauss thought of uniform circular motion as being merely the visible
artifact of the more complex motion associated with circular functions.

This is illustrated in the accompanying animations. In [animation

, the circular rotation generates the trigonometric relationships.
[Animation

illustrates the inverse, where the visible effect of the circle is
created as an artifact of the movement of the cosine and sine. In the
visible domain, this seems impossible. How can you know the relationship
of the cosine to the sine without first drawing the circle? But in the
domain of reason, the essential nature of the sine and cosine can be
{known} by inversion, as those functional relationships that produce
circular areas.

In the case of the circle, this method may seem a bit arcane and clumsy,
and so it was resisted by virtually every scientific thinker of Gauss's
time. But Gauss recognized that this method of inversion, rooted in the
method of the ancient Greeks, was required to discover the nature of the
elliptical transcendentals. For because of the incommensurability of the
arc to both the line and angle, there was no way to generate, from the
visible characteristics of an ellipse, a characteristic elliptical
function, and all efforts to measure elliptical motion from circular
transcendentals failed.

Gauss posed the elliptical problem in exactly these terms. He {knew} the
higher elliptical functions must exist, and that they could not be
defined directly. "What characteristics must such functions have to
produce the ever changing elliptical motion?" Gauss can be imagined to
have asked. "How can such characteristics be made intelligible?" This is
the only way these functions can become known. Not directly, but only as
that which is inverse to elliptical motion.

This thought will undoubtedly provoke psychological resistance in the
modern reader, steeped in the culture of Aristotle and empiricism, who
so strongly desires logical proofs presented in the visible domain. But
it is the method of all Classical science and Classical art. It requires
the mind to move; to willfully create new concepts. Hence, the benefit
of reliving Gauss's true discovery.

When the algebraists, such as Euler, Lagrange, et al. had tried to
express the elliptical motion using their formalized, non-physical and,
therefore, false version of the calculus they produced a formal
representation of the elliptical motion that defied all their efforts at
calculation. Gauss flanked them all by focusing on the simplest such
case, the lemniscate of Bernoulli, which had been shown to be a special
case of an elliptical type non-uniform curve.

Gauss's choice of flank was rooted in Kepler's insight into conic
sections. Kepler had generalized Apollonius's conics by recognizing the
projective relationship among the conic sections as a whole. (See
Hyperbolic Functions: A Fugue Across 25 Centuries.). Kepler had shown,
by inversion, that all conic sections were generated by a single
principle. However, he made particular notice of the significance of the
discontinuity in the visible manifestation of this principle, expressed
as an infinite boundary between the circle/ellipse and the hyperbola.

It was Gauss's insight that the lemniscate expressed the higher,
unified, principle that generated the conic sections. In its projected,
visible form, the lemniscate is the locus of positions in which the
product of the distances from a point on the curve to two foci, is equal
to the square of ? the distance between those foci. [(See Figure
6.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part51_files_part51figure06.gif)
. Or, in other words, the distance from one focus to the center of the
lemniscate is the geometric mean between the two distances from the
curve to each of the foci respectively.

However, the lemniscate has a more general relationship to the
generating principle of the conic sections, and to the elliptical
functions in particular, that can be grasped intuitively from the higher
standpoint of Gauss and Riemann. On the one hand, the lemniscate can be
generated as the inversion of the hyperbola in a circle. [(See Figure
7.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part51_files_part51figure07.gif)

From this more advanced standpoint, the hyperbola can be seen as the
stereographic projection from a sphere onto a plane of a lemniscate.

Here we can begin to see emerge the essential characteristics of the
elliptical transcendentals, from the standpoint of Gauss's principles of
curvature. (See On Principles and Powers, Fidelio, Summer 2003.) The
lemniscate on a sphere is generated as a mapping of the transition
between the sections of positive and negative curvature of a torus.
[(See Figure
9.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part51_files_part51figure09.gif)
And as Riemann would later demonstrate, the torus expresses a different
topology (geometry of position) than the sphere or the ellipsoid. On the
sphere or ellipsoid any closed curve separates the surface into two
parts. But this is not the case on the torus where there are two
distinct types of pathways, one around the torus, and the other through
the "hole". This characteristic, Riemann showed, expressed the double
periodicity of the elliptical functions. [(See Figure
10.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part51_files_part51figure10.gif)

Thus, enfolded in the lemniscate, and also in the ellipse, is the
characteristic of double periodicity which is unfolded in the form of
the torus. Additionally, hidden in the torus, if cut in the right way,
one finds, the lemnsicate.

Here is the geometry of position that establishes the unseen, but
nevertheless real, "orbit" which exists behind the elliptical functions.

We will come back to this discussion in future installments of this
series. But for now, from this high perch, look back to Archytas with a
justified sense of happiness.

Appendix

Moral from the History of the Infinitesimal Calculus

by A.G. Kaestner

When the question of calculating the infinite first arose, the most
famous mathematical wise men had an aversion to it. Their habitual
methods of discovering mathematical truths appeared to them to be clear
and secure; whereas with the new one, they found dark secrets, much that
was uncertain, and in the main, a degree of subtlety which they would
rather forgo.

To convert these scorners, a cure was supplied by the camp of Leibniz
and his friends, roughly as follows:

It was demonstrated that the calculation of the infinite was in
agreement with all prevailing customary theories, in that it easily and
comfortably led to truths which previously could only be attained by
tiresome cogitation, and, finally, because it enlarged hitherto existing
knowledge, such that the summit of Archimedes' discovery was its lowest
boundary; with it, one could answer, in total completeness, questions
which could only be answered incompletely, or not at all, by the
previously known feats of mathematical skill. And thus, the calculation
of the infinite won the respect of an eye which, even without it, had
made so many, so great discoveries.

How much would the Christian faith not gain, if its followers were to
show, through their own acts, that with regard to the exercise of
virtue, it has the same superiority over every other religion, as makes
a Christian deserving of being admired by Socrates?

But many of these followers, and even their teachers, strike me today
like someone who would go around constantly spouting higher mathematics
and dropping Euler's name, and who would declare anyone who could not
integrate to be a dunce, but who would personally make errors as
frequently as he was asked to calculate a Rule of Three!

Riemann for Anti-Dummies Part 51

THE POWER OF NUMBER

Nicholas of Cusa begins "On Learned Ignorance", by reaching back to the
method of Pythagoras:

"Therefore, every inquiry proceeds through proportion, whether an easy
or difficult one. Hence, the infinite qua infinite, is unknown; for it
escapes all proportion. But since proportion indicates an agreement in
some one respect and, at the same time, indicates an otherness, it
cannot be understood independently of number. Accordingly, number
encompasses all things related proportionally. Therefore, number, which
is a necessary condition of proportion, is present not only in quantity
but also in all things which in any manner whatsoever can agree or
differ either substantially or accidentally. Perhaps for this reason
Pythagoras deemed all things to be constituted and understood through
the power of numbers."

Here, Cusa adopts the view of Plato, that numbers arise from the
inseparable interaction between the human mind and the physical
universe. The mind expresses the concepts it creates, about the
principles it discovers, through the power of numbers. These concepts
themselves become objects of the mind's investigation, and the
relationships among these "thought-objects", also give rise to concepts,
which are themselves expressible through the power of number.

Numbers in and of themselves have no power. They are like ironies that
point, by inversion, to the principles that govern the physical
universe. Those principles don't exist in the numbers. They exist
"behind" the numbers. Thus, the significance of Cusa's reference that
the Pythagoreans deemed all things to be {constituted and understood}
through the power of numbers.

Against Cusa's understanding of Pythagoras is the far different fraud
perpetrated by the Sophists who, then and now, insist on separating the
conjoined idea {constituted and understood}. For them, as for Aristotle,
how things are {constituted}, and how things are {understood}, are two
separate and mutually exclusive actions. In his "Metaphysics", Aristotle
attacks both Plato and the Pythagoreans for their insistence that ideas
are an active principle in the Universe:

"But the lauded characteristics of numbers, and the contraries of these,
and generally the mathematical relations, as some describe them, making
them causes of nature, seem, when we inspect them in this way, to
vanish; for none of them is a cause in any of the senses that have been
distinguished in reference to the first principles. In a sense, however,
they make it plain that goodness belongs to numbers, and that the odd,
the straight, the square, the potencies of certain numbers, are in the
column of the beautiful. For the seasons and a particular kind of number
go together; and the other agreements that they collect from the
theorems of mathematics all have this meaning. Hence they are like
coincidences. For they are accidents..."

Aristotle's method is pure sophistry. As Cusa and Plato both indicate,
number arises in the {human} mind through the effort to discover the
unseen universal principles that govern the world behind the senses.
Thus, the power of numbers is {deliberate}, not accidental. However,
Aristotle plays the trick of separating the world of mind and the world
of matter, and so, for him, any connection between number and the
physical world is purely accidental.

But Aristotle does not have clean hands. He is the hired-gun who
provides the oligarchy with the method it needs, to create the cultural
basis it requires, to assume its arbitrary authority over humanity. By
introducing this false separation between the universe of sensible
things, the unseen principles that govern them, and the thoughts by
which we understand those principles, Aristotle excises human cognition
as an active principle from the Universe. Once cleansed of cognition, he
creates a false universe, indifferent to the power of human thought,
unknowable, and governed by mysterious forces accessible only to those
with access to special incantations, such as the moans of the oracles of
ancient Delphi, or the formulas of formal mathematics.

That is the form of sophistry from which Cusa rescued civilization.

This is not an arcane technical argument, but one that goes to the heart
of the difference between man and beast.

As Cusa stated this explicitly in "On Conjectures":

"The natural sprouting origin of the rational art is number; indeed,
beings which possess no intellect, such as animals, do not count. Number
is nothing other than unfolded rationality...

"...we conjecture symbolically from the rational numbers of our mind in
respect to the real ineffable numbers of the divine Mind, we indeed say
that number is the prime exemplar of things in the mind of the Composer,
just as the number arising from our rationality is the exemplar of the
imaginal world."

Cusa's view was later adopted by Leibniz, who wrote in "Reflections on
the Souls of Beasts":

"However, lest we seem to equate man and beast too closely, it should be
known that there is an enormous difference between the perception of
humans and beasts. For besides the lowest degree of perception that is
found even in insensible creatures, and (as been explained) a middle
degree which we call sensation and acknowledge in beasts, there is a
certain higher degree which we call thought. But thought is perception
joined with reason, which beasts so far as we can observe do not have.

"...However, a human being, insofar as he does not act empirically but
rationally, does not rely solely on experience, or a posteriori
inductions from particular cases, but proceeds a priori on the basis of
reasons. And this is the difference between a geometer, or one trained
in analysis, and an ordinary user of arithmetic, teaching children, who
learn arithmetical rules by rote, but do not know the reason for them,
and consequently cannot decide questions that depart from what they are
used to: such is the difference between the empirical and the rational,
between the inferences of beasts and the reasoning of human
beings....Thus, brutes (as far as we can observe) do not acquire
knowledge of the universality of propositions, because they do not
understand the ground of necessity. And even if empirics are sometimes
led by inductions to universally true propositions, this nonetheless
happens only accidentally, not by force of entailment."

Creating Number

This concept of number is what Gauss had in mind when, provoked by the
paradoxes associated with the "Kepler Problem", he sought the discovery
of those hitherto unknown higher transcendentals indicated by Kepler's
discovery. Gauss recognized, in the tradition of the Pythagoreans,
Plato, Cusa and Leibniz, that these new numbers, like all numbers,
cannot be defined by any set of formal, deductive rules, such as in the
methods of Aristotle, or his philosophical protege, the Leibniz-hating
Euler. Rather, Gauss understood that these new transcendentals, like all
numbers, could only by defined by {inversion} with respect to a physical
process.

To illustrate this point, take a case you think you are familiar with,
and look at it, as Gauss did, from an entirely new standpoint: the
number associated with the relationship of two squares whose areas are
in the proportion 1:2, which is sometimes called, "the square root of
two".

Construct a square from a circle. Now construct a square whose area is
double. How do you know the areas of these two squares are in the
proportion 1:2? Not by looking at them. There is nothing in the visible
appearance of the two squares from which you can {know} the proportion
of their areas. You can know this only from the method of construction,
as Plato discusses that method in the Meno dialogue.

Now, look at the diagonal and the side of the square. These look the
same. Both are lines. There is nothing in the visible appearance of
these lines from which you can {know} their proportion, other than to
say one is a little longer than the other. Yet, the Pythagoreans
{proved} that the two lines are {incommensurable}, or in other words,
had no common measure. This incommensurability cannot be demonstrated
from the visible appearance of the lines, but, only, as the Pythagoreans
did, by investigating the relationship itself between magnitudes that
are commensurable in length and those commensurable as squares. The
Pythagoreans showed that no linear proportion could possibly exist,
whose square is in the proportion 1:2. (See Jason Ross article Fall 2003
21st Century.).

Most importantly, this characteristic of incommensurability is
independent of the actual size of the squares. It depends only on the
proportion between their areas, which is determined only by
construction. As such, this incommensurability expresses a
characteristic of the physical process of the construction of the
squares. Consequently, the number called "the square root of 2", cannot
be defined by any set of rules, definitions or procedures such as a
logical deductive method, but only by an inversion, as {that which
expresses the principle with the power to generate two squares whose
areas are in the proportion 1:2}.

In the visible domain, we proceeded in the opposite manner. We
constructed the squares and produced the magnitude called, "the square
root of two". But from the standpoint of physical principles, it is the
incommensurability of the magnitude called the square root of two which
expresses the {power} (possibility) to produce two squares whose areas
are in the proportion 1:2.

As Thales, Pythagoras, Theodorus, and Theatetus, further demonstrated,
the square root of two is merely a special case of a more general
species of relationships generated from circular action, which they
called one geometric mean between two extremes. [(See Figure
1.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part51_files_part51figure01.gif)
As point P moves from A to O, the length of the line QP will always be
the geometric mean between the lengths of line OQ and QA. When OQ is one
half of QA, then QP is the magnitude called "the square root of 2".

The particular proportion is independent of the size of the circle or
the actual lengths of the lines. It depends solely on the position of P
with respect to A and O, the which is determined by the circular "orbit"
on which P travels. Thus, the circular "orbit" on which P travels
produces, as a whole, a complete "type" or "species" of proportions,
with respect to the magnitudes OQ, QP and QA.

This is one of the simplest examples of the Greek method of the geometry
of position ("topos") known today by the Latin word, "loci", in which
proportions are understood as generated from some physical action.

Another famous example of this method of loci is Archytas's construction
of cubic magnitudes. Here, an entirely new species of magnitudes is
generated by combining two degrees of circular rotation orthogonal to
each other, producing the torus and cylinder whose intersection defines
a different "orbit" on which P travels. Again, these relationships are
dependant only on the characteristic of the "orbit", not on the size of
the circles, or the surfaces generated from them.

The solid loci, or conics, of Menaechmus and Apollonius, follows the
same principle, of generating both square and cubic magnitudes from
{action acting on action}.

But here we seem to have run into a boundary. The change in the motion
that generates one mean between two extremes (squares) to the motion
that generates two means (cubes), was effected by introducing a second
degree of circular action acting orthogonally to the first. Visible
space, however, does not permit the addition of a third degree of
circular action acting orthogonally to these two. Does that mean that no
higher powers are possible? And, if they are possible, how are they
manifest physically, as distinct from some formal mathematical algebraic
definition?

Ultimately, it was Leibniz's discovery of the catenary principle that
demonstrated the physical existence of these higher powers. But that
discovery rested on a previous one by Cusa, which is necessary to review
for the sake of the subject matter to follow.

Look again at the generation of geometric means from circular action,
but this time from the standpoint of inversion. As was demonstrated
above, the circular "orbit" of P generates the entire species of
geometric means. But what about the inverse? Can the entire species of
geometric means produce a circle?

Cusa demonstrated that the answer was no, that, in fact, there exists a
higher principle that generates the circle, which Leibniz later called,
"transcendental". These "circular transcendentals" are identified with
those interrelated magnitudes known as trigonometric functions, and the
relationships among them express the incommensurability between the
curved and the straight. [(See Figure
2.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part51_files_part51figure02.gif)

As Cusa showed, this incommensurability between the curved and the
straight, is a different type than the incommensurability expressed by
squares or cubes, and, the higher "algebraic" powers. Later, Leibniz,
through his discovery of the catenary principle and its relationship to
natural logarithms, demonstrated that all species of algebraic powers
are generated by these transcendental functions, and it is these
transcendental magnitudes, not the algebraic, that express the
relationships that arise in the physical universe.

It is crucial to restate this point in this form:{ The transcendental
functions, not the algebraic, are those functions that are inverse to
circular rotation}. The significance of this statement will become more
clear from the standpoint of the discovery of the higher, elliptical
functions, by Gauss and Riemann.

Elliptical Functions From Kepler to Leibniz

Through his education by E.A.W. Zimmerman and A.G. Kaestner, both
leading defenders of Leibniz and Kepler, Gauss was focused, from his
early adolescence, to investigate the implications of the paradoxes
arising from the "Kepler Problem" that were left unresolved by Leibniz's
invention of the infinitesimal calculus. (See Riemann for Anti-Dummies,
Part 49, Aug. 16, 2003.)

As Kepler demonstrated, the ellipticity of a planetary orbit demanded a
new type of geometry of position, one that expressed the position of the
planet as a function of the characteristic of change of the orbit as a
whole. Kepler's effort to develop this concept resulted in his famous
principle of equal areas. He recognized that in every interval of an
elliptical orbit, no matter how small, the motion of the planet at the
beginning of that interval is different than at the end. The only
interval excepted is one entire orbital period. In that case, the planet
is doing the same thing at the beginning and end of the interval. Thus,
Kepler made the entire orbit the primary interval of action, and
measured the planet's intermediate motion as portions of the whole
orbit.

In The New Astronomy, Kepler, citing Archimedes, measures this
relationship by the proportion of the total area of the planet's orbit,
to the area swept out in a given interval. He defines the area swept out
by the planet as the "sum" of the infinite number of radial distances:

{"For the whole sum of the radial distances is, to the whole periodic
time, as any partial sum of the distances is to its corresponding
time."}

For Kepler, the planet's motion was thus measured by the changing
proportion between the part of the orbit and the whole. This proportion,
Kepler understood to be the "time-elapsed" within any given interval.

It is extremely important to recognize the difference between Kepler's
actual principle and the Newtonian-algebraic formulation, misidentified
as "Kepler's second-law", and stated in text-book gossip circles as:
"the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times". This historically
and epistemologically false characterization is a clinical example of an
Aristotlean-type sophistry in two important ways. First, it falsely
characterizes Kepler's discovered principle as a mathematical "law",
thereby excising out the cognitive action. Second, by stating this law
in the form of a proportion between area and time, it transforms time
and space, by fiat definition, into independent absolute magnitudes. In
this way, the Universe is turned on its head. Instead of recognizing the
characteristics of space and time as functions of the physical motion of
the planet, the fantasy pseudo-world of absolute time and space is held
to define the planet's motion.

Responding to Kepler's demand for a generalization of his principle,
Leibniz developed the infinitesimal calculus, by extending Kepler's
proportionality between the part and the whole, into infinitesimal
intervals of action.

For Leibniz, the infinitesimal is physically determined as a
proportionality, as Cusa understood proportionality, between the
inseparable part and whole of a physical process. His critics reacted by
reaching back to the ancient sophistries of the Eleatics, and, like
Zeno, posed the paradoxes of physical motion from the standpoint of an
arbitrary formal mathematical definition of a curve. Leibniz defended
himself from these attacks during his lifetime, but after his death, the
oligarchy recruited Euler to give a more "academic" imprimatur to these
attacks, as expressed most blatantly in his Letters to a German
Princess.

In response to Euler, Leibniz was posthumously defended, on precisely
this point, by those who were fighting to establish the American
Republic against the oligarchy that employed Euler, most notably by A.G.
Kaestner. (See Appended essay by Kaestner, Moral from the History of the
Infinitesimal Calculus.)

Elliptical Functions of Gauss

Ironically, while Leibniz's discovery of the catenary principle
demonstrated the power of his infinitesimal calculus, its application to
the elliptical orbit, the problem that had provoked its invention, led
to the paradox known as the "Kepler Problem". The essential
characteristics of this paradox can be understood by investigating the
difference between a circular orbit and an elliptical one from the
standpoint of Kepler and Leibniz.

In a circular orbit the area swept out can be measured directly by the
angle. In the elliptical orbit, as Kepler showed, the area swept out is
measured by a circular sector and a rectilinear triangle. [(See Figures
3)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part51_files_part51figure03.gif)

The incommensurability between the triangle and the circular sector
leads to the "Kepler Problem". [(See Figure

Gauss recognized that this paradox arose from the effort to measure the
elliptical action of the planet by circular functions. The problem here
was that while the circular functions reflect the incommensurability
between the arc and the line, in elliptical action there exists an
incommensurability between the arc and the angle as well. [(See Figure
5.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part51_files_part51figure05.gif)
Gauss realized that since these two types of incommensurability were
connected, both arising from a unified elliptical action, there must
exist a new, more general type of elliptical transcendental, of which
the circular functions were only a special case. The complex domain was
required to make intelligible the relationships associated with these
new transcendentals.

This investigation forms the core of Gauss's youthful work, as a review
of his early notebooks and correspondence reveals. Gauss presented some
aspects of these discoveries more formally in his 1799 new proof of the
Fundamental Theorem of Algebra and his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, as
well as his later works in astronomy, geodesy, and curvature. But
because of the tyranny imposed on Europe in the post-1789 reaction to
the American Revolution, (especially after the 1799 consolidation of
Napoleon's rise to power and its aftermath) some of these discoveries
were never published, and only found their expression in the work of the
next generation of scientists, most notably, Dirichlet, Riemann, Abel,
and Jacobi, who were themselves influenced by Gauss, and the Leibnizian
networks with which Kaestner was associated, such as the Humboldts,
Schiller, Herbart et al.

Because of this fragmentary nature of Gauss's early writings, much of
Gauss's thinking is expressed in abbreviated form. It becomes
pedagogically much easier, therefore, to present the nature of his
discovery, from the standpoint of his later work on curvature and
Riemann's elaboration of those ideas, most notably, in his famous
treatise on Abelian functions. As in Gauss's 1799 proof of the
fundamental theorem of algebra, both Gauss and Riemann indicated the
superiority of geometrical construction to algebraic formulas for
conveying ideas.

The crux of Gauss's method was that of the ancient Greeks, Cusa, Kepler
and Leibniz: that nothing could be known from the visible manifestation
of the circle or the ellipse. Rather, these visible characteristics,
such as the uniformity or non-uniformity of the arcs, were a function of
some underlying principle. That principle, however, was not visible, and
could only be discovered by inversion. In other words, those principles
could not be seen, but could be known, as, that which produces the
visible characteristics of curvature.

To illustrate Gauss' inverse method geometrically, take a new look at
the trigonometric relationships. In the visible domain, the
trigonometric relationships are generated as an effect of circular
motion. But, as Cusa indicated (for which Kepler called him "divine"),
the harmonic characteristics are found not in circular action alone, but
in the incommensurability between the curved and the straight. Thus,
Gauss thought of uniform circular motion as being merely the visible
artifact of the more complex motion associated with circular functions.

This is illustrated in the accompanying animations. In [animation
1](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part51_files_part51animation01.gif)
, the circular rotation generates the trigonometric relationships.
[Animation
2](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part51_files_part51animation02.gif)
illustrates the inverse, where the visible effect of the circle is
created as an artifact of the movement of the cosine and sine. In the
visible domain, this seems impossible. How can you know the relationship
of the cosine to the sine without first drawing the circle? But in the
domain of reason, the essential nature of the sine and cosine can be
{known} by inversion, as those functional relationships that produce
circular areas.

In the case of the circle, this method may seem a bit arcane and clumsy,
and so it was resisted by virtually every scientific thinker of Gauss's
time. But Gauss recognized that this method of inversion, rooted in the
method of the ancient Greeks, was required to discover the nature of the
elliptical transcendentals. For because of the incommensurability of the
arc to both the line and angle, there was no way to generate, from the
visible characteristics of an ellipse, a characteristic elliptical
function, and all efforts to measure elliptical motion from circular
transcendentals failed.

Gauss posed the elliptical problem in exactly these terms. He {knew} the
higher elliptical functions must exist, and that they could not be
defined directly. "What characteristics must such functions have to
produce the ever changing elliptical motion?" Gauss can be imagined to
have asked. "How can such characteristics be made intelligible?" This is
the only way these functions can become known. Not directly, but only as
that which is inverse to elliptical motion.

This thought will undoubtedly provoke psychological resistance in the
modern reader, steeped in the culture of Aristotle and empiricism, who
so strongly desires logical proofs presented in the visible domain. But
it is the method of all Classical science and Classical art. It requires
the mind to move; to willfully create new concepts. Hence, the benefit
of reliving Gauss's true discovery.

When the algebraists, such as Euler, Lagrange, et al. had tried to
express the elliptical motion using their formalized, non-physical and,
therefore, false version of the calculus they produced a formal
representation of the elliptical motion that defied all their efforts at
calculation. Gauss flanked them all by focusing on the simplest such
case, the lemniscate of Bernoulli, which had been shown to be a special
case of an elliptical type non-uniform curve.

Gauss's choice of flank was rooted in Kepler's insight into conic
sections. Kepler had generalized Apollonius's conics by recognizing the
projective relationship among the conic sections as a whole. (See
Hyperbolic Functions: A Fugue Across 25 Centuries.). Kepler had shown,
by inversion, that all conic sections were generated by a single
principle. However, he made particular notice of the significance of the
discontinuity in the visible manifestation of this principle, expressed
as an infinite boundary between the circle/ellipse and the hyperbola.

It was Gauss's insight that the lemniscate expressed the higher,
unified, principle that generated the conic sections. In its projected,
visible form, the lemniscate is the locus of positions in which the
product of the distances from a point on the curve to two foci, is equal
to the square of ? the distance between those foci. [(See Figure
6.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part51_files_part51figure06.gif)
. Or, in other words, the distance from one focus to the center of the
lemniscate is the geometric mean between the two distances from the
curve to each of the foci respectively.

However, the lemniscate has a more general relationship to the
generating principle of the conic sections, and to the elliptical
functions in particular, that can be grasped intuitively from the higher
standpoint of Gauss and Riemann. On the one hand, the lemniscate can be
generated as the inversion of the hyperbola in a circle. [(See Figure
7.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part51_files_part51figure07.gif)

From this more advanced standpoint, the hyperbola can be seen as the
stereographic projection from a sphere onto a plane of a lemniscate.

Here we can begin to see emerge the essential characteristics of the
elliptical transcendentals, from the standpoint of Gauss's principles of
curvature. (See On Principles and Powers, Fidelio, Summer 2003.) The
lemniscate on a sphere is generated as a mapping of the transition
between the sections of positive and negative curvature of a torus.
[(See Figure
9.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part51_files_part51figure09.gif)
And as Riemann would later demonstrate, the torus expresses a different
topology (geometry of position) than the sphere or the ellipsoid. On the
sphere or ellipsoid any closed curve separates the surface into two
parts. But this is not the case on the torus where there are two
distinct types of pathways, one around the torus, and the other through
the "hole". This characteristic, Riemann showed, expressed the double
periodicity of the elliptical functions. [(See Figure
10.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part51_files_part51figure10.gif)

Thus, enfolded in the lemniscate, and also in the ellipse, is the
characteristic of double periodicity which is unfolded in the form of
the torus. Additionally, hidden in the torus, if cut in the right way,
one finds, the lemnsicate.

Here is the geometry of position that establishes the unseen, but
nevertheless real, "orbit" which exists behind the elliptical functions.

We will come back to this discussion in future installments of this
series. But for now, from this high perch, look back to Archytas with a
justified sense of happiness.

Appendix

Moral from the History of the Infinitesimal Calculus

by A.G. Kaestner

When the question of calculating the infinite first arose, the most
famous mathematical wise men had an aversion to it. Their habitual
methods of discovering mathematical truths appeared to them to be clear
and secure; whereas with the new one, they found dark secrets, much that
was uncertain, and in the main, a degree of subtlety which they would
rather forgo.

To convert these scorners, a cure was supplied by the camp of Leibniz
and his friends, roughly as follows:

It was demonstrated that the calculation of the infinite was in
agreement with all prevailing customary theories, in that it easily and
comfortably led to truths which previously could only be attained by
tiresome cogitation, and, finally, because it enlarged hitherto existing
knowledge, such that the summit of Archimedes' discovery was its lowest
boundary; with it, one could answer, in total completeness, questions
which could only be answered incompletely, or not at all, by the
previously known feats of mathematical skill. And thus, the calculation
of the infinite won the respect of an eye which, even without it, had
made so many, so great discoveries.

How much would the Christian faith not gain, if its followers were to
show, through their own acts, that with regard to the exercise of
virtue, it has the same superiority over every other religion, as makes
a Christian deserving of being admired by Socrates?

But many of these followers, and even their teachers, strike me today
like someone who would go around constantly spouting higher mathematics
and dropping Euler's name, and who would declare anyone who could not
integrate to be a dunce, but who would personally make errors as
frequently as he was asked to calculate a Rule of Three!
