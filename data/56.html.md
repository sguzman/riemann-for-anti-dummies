## RIEMANNIAN SPHERICS {#riemannian-spherics style="text-align: left"}

When Carl Friedrich Gauss repeatedly stated his conviction that
Euclidean geometry was not true, his thoughts were connected to the
pre-Euclidean science of the Pythagoreans and Plato. However Gauss's
"{anti}-Euclideanism" was not a mere restatement of its antecedent.
Rather, Gauss, and later Riemann, sublimated the ancient
Egyptian-Pythagorean science of "spherics" with a new spherics, that had
been demanded by Cusa's discovery of transcendental physical action, the
development of Kepler's discovery of the harmonics of elliptical
planetary orbits, and Leibniz's generalization of both, as the universal
principle of least-action.

This is the vantage point from which to gain a firmer grasp of Riemann's
treatment of Abelian and hypergeometric functions.

The relevant characteristics of the Pythagorean concept of spherics are
summarized in the Plato dialogue, named for the astronomer Timaeus, who,
attributing the origin of his discourse to the testimony of wise men
from more ancient times, recounts the nature and creation of the
universe. Timaeus begins by noting that investigations of the created
world must focus on the eternal universal principles from which it is
patterned. Though "apprehensible by reason and thought,", those
principles are, of necessity, reflected in the world's physical form.
Accordingly, when speaking about the physical universe, Timaeus
emphasizes, it is most important to distinguish between the original
principles and their created copy, and one must be careful to recognize
that a simple description of the latter cannot suffice for an
explanation of the former.

"Accordingly, in dealing with a copy and its model, we must affirm that
the accounts given will themselves be akin to the diverse objects which
they serve to explain; those which deal with what is abiding and firm
and discernible by the aid of thought will be abiding and unshakable;
and in so far as it is possible and fitting for statements to be
irrefutable and invincible, they must in no wise fall short thereof;
whereas the accounts of that which is copied after the likeness of that
model, and is itself a likeness, will be analogous thereof and possess
likelihood; for as Being is to Becoming, so is Truth to Belief.
Wherefore, Socrates, if in our treatment of a great host of matters
regarding the Gods and the generation of the Universe we prove unable to
give accounts that are always in all respects self-consistent and
perfectly exact, be not thou surprised; rather we should be content if
we can furnish accounts that are inferior to none in likelihood,
remembering that both I who speak and you who judge are but human
creatures, so that it becomes us to accept the likely account of these
matters and forbear to search beyond it." (29c-d)

Timaeus goes on to say that the Creator, being good, intended for that
goodness to be reflected in the creation and so he endowed it with
intelligence and soul, and brought it into existence as a self moving,
self-subsisting living creature.

"He fashioned it to be One single Whole, compounded of all wholes,
perfect and ageless and unailing. And he bestowed on it the shape which
was befitting and akin. Now for that living creature which is designed
to embrace within itself all living creatures, the fitting shape will be
that which comprises within itself all the shapes there are; wherefore
he wrought it into a round, in the shape of a sphere, equidistant in all
directions from the center to extremities, which of all shapes is the
most perfect and most self-similar, since he deemed that the similar is
infinitely fairer than the dissimilar....

"Such then was the reasoning of the ever-existing God concerning the god
which was one day to become existent, whereby He made it smooth and even
and equal on all sides from the center, a whole and perfect body
compounded of perfect bodies, and in the midst thereof He set soul,
which He stretched throughout the whole of it; therewith He enveloped
also the exterior of its body; and as a circle revolving in a circle He
established one sole and solitary Heaven, able of itself because of its
excellence to company with itself and needing none other beside,
sufficing unto itself an acquaintance and friend. And because of all
this He generated it to be a blessed God.." (34-b.)

This spherical form, Timaeus explains, expresses not only the goodness
and perfection of a universe patterned from reason and intelligence, but
it also expresses the motions of the visible objects in the heavens as
well. These visible objects, whose individual motions trace circular
arcs onto the celestial sphere, form the "moving image of eternity" we
call time. Timaeus proceeds to recount, in detail, the diverse motions
of these celestial objects, the totality of which are visible
expressions of that which is eternal and universal.

But Plato emphasized that these characteristic spherical motions, while
a means to express the characteristics of an idea, cannot, by
themselves, be taken as knowledge of the idea. But, being patterned
after the eternal, their study can aid us in grasping what can only be
apprehended by reason and thought:

"Thus, said I. These sparks that paint the sky, since they are
decorations on a visible surface, we must regard, to be sure, as the
fairest and most exact of material things, but we must recognize that
they fall far short of the truth, of the movements, namely of real speed
and real slowness in true number and in all true figures both in
relation to one another and as vehicles of the things they carry and
contain. These can be apprehended only by reason and thought, but not by
sight, or do you think otherwise?

By no means, he said.

Then, said I, we must use the blazonry of the heavens as patterns to aid
in the study of those realities, just as one would do who chanced upon
diagrams drawn with special care and elaboration by Daedalus or some
other craftsman or painter. For anyone acquainted with geometry who saw
such designs would admit the beauty of the workmanship, but, would think
it absurd to examine them seriously in the expectation of finding in
them the absolute truth with regard to equals or doubles or any other
ratio." (Rep. 529e-530b)

The Boundaries of the Sphere

Because these visible expressions could also mislead reason, Plato
cautioned against the methods of the Sophists and Eleatics, (forerunners
of today's mathematical formalists and information theorists), whose
practice, like their modern counterparts, was to induce insanity in
their victims by restricting their attention to the visible form of
mathematical objects that have been disconnected from the universal
principles from which they arose, and, from the ideas whose shadows they
were intended to represent. As he warned in the {Republic}:

"This at least, said I, will not be disputed by those who have even a
slight acquaintance with geometry (earth-measure), that this science is
in direct contradiction with the language employed in it by its adepts.

How so? he said.

Their language is most ludicrous, though they cannot help it, for they
speak as if they were doing something and as if all their words were
directed toward action. For all their talk is of squaring and applying
the adding and the like, whereas in fact the real object of the entire
study is pure knowledge.

This is absolutely true, he said.

And must we not agree on a further point?

What?

That it is the knowledge of that which always is, and not of a something
which at some time comes into being and passes away.

That is readily admitted, he said, for geometry is the knowledge of the
eternally existent." (Rep. 527a.)

The Sophists insisted that geometry could state nothing truthful
concerning "knowledge about that which always is" because geometrical
objects, being objects of sense, lie in the domain of that which is
always changing. Consequently for the sophist, geometrical objects, like
all other objects of sense, could be connected to each other by a set of
formal rules, described and manipulated, but such actions were {by
definition} divorced from the eternal physical principles governing the
universe itself. By limiting scientific inquiry to such objects of sense
perception, as Aristotle also maintained, the Sophists could awe their
audiences with dazzling demonstrations, such as the simultaneous
existence and non-existence of the one and the many, while convincing
them that knowledge of universal principles was, in the end, beyond
their grasp.

By contrast, the Pythagorean-Platonic scientists admitted no objects
into geometry that did not arise in connection with an effort to grasp
an unseen, eternal, universal principle. Such objects, such as the
Pythagorean concept of the sphere, were brought into existence by an
action of a mind intending to gain greater mastery over the principles
that govern the universe itself. Consequently for these Socratics, all
such geometrical objects are representations of ideas that are
apprehensible only by reason and thought. "Thought-objects" so generated
contain within them, the essential characteristics of the universal
principles they are intended to grasp. Being thus connected to universal
principles, paradoxes generated by the investigation of such objects,
point to the existence of unknown principles, that, once discovered,
lead to the generation of new ideas, that demand new types of
geometrical expression.

In the science of Classical Greece, this is exemplified by the
uniqueness of the five regular solids. Nothing in the smooth, everywhere
same, form of a sphere gives any indication of the existence of a
bounding principle that determines that there be five, and only five,
unique solids that equally divide that everywhere constant surface. But,
the fact that only five such solids can be constructed, reveals the
existence, and reflects the characteristics, of that bounding principle.
Thus, even though the sphere is the shape "that comprises all shapes",
the five regular solids indicate the existence of a still higher
principle from which the sphere's power is derived. This higher power,
though outside the visible boundary of the sphere, is, nevertheless,
expressed on the sphere's surface, by the uniqueness of the five regular
solids.

That that higher principle can be found only by surpassing the
boundaries of the sphere, was already evident to the Pythagoreans, as
indicated by Archytas's construction for the doubling of the cube by the
intersection of a torus, cylinder and cone. This stands in contrast to
the doubling of the square, whose generating principle can be expressed
by circular action existing within the same manifold (plane) in which
the square itself is generated. On the other hand, the cube, which is
formed in the sphere, cannot be doubled by means of spherical action. As
Archytas demonstrated, a more complex unfolding of the sphere is
required. Thus, the characteristic of the cube, as well as the other
four regular solids, indicated to the Pythagoreans and Plato, the
existence of a still higher principle that bounds the apparently
self-bounded spherical form.

Because of paradoxes like these, Plato insisted that the study of these
solids should be emphasized, in addition to the Pythagorean quadrivium
of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music, in the education of
political leaders, so that those leaders could develop the cognitive
powers to recognize universal principles and act only on the basis of
truth, not on the basis of arbitrary opinion.

For opposing reasons, Aristotle introduced the arbitrary fiction that
the form of the universe is an unbounded, empty, linearly extended void,
as codified in the Elements of Euclid. Under this scheme, spherical
action is not the reflection of the universal principles from which it
is generated. It is but only one, of infinitely many undifferentiated
possible types of action. For Euclid, the sphere's existence, like the
rest of the objects of Euclidean geometry, rests only on the authority
of an {a priori} set of definitions, axioms and postulates. For Euclid,
and those indoctrinated by sophism, empiricism, etc. this false, fantasy
world of linear action becomes the only true one from which all physical
processes deviate.

Ironically, the Pythagorean-Platonic method expressed as self-bounded
spherical action reflects the unlimited potential for the discovery of
new physical principles, because the existence of these new principles
is indicated through the emergence of paradoxes, such as the uniqueness
of the five regular solids. On the other hand, the
Aristotelean-Euclidean fantasy of an apparently unbounded, linearly
extended void, that, {by definition}, permits no physical principles
within its midst, acts as a barrier to the introduction of new ideas,
restricting human knowledge to a definite and finite domain: a barrier
that held back human progress for nearly 1500 years, from the murder of
Archimedes in 231 B.C. until the dawn of the European Renaissance in the
14th century.

In sum: the self-bounded is unlimited potential; the unbounded is
forever constrained.

Surpassing the Boundaries of the Self-Bounded Sphere

The Aristotelean barrier was cracked when Nicholas of Cusa re-introduced
the Pythagorean-Platonic concept of spherics, in the new, more advanced
form of his method of "On Learned Ignorance". Like his forerunners, Cusa
understood that mathematical objects, generated as metaphors, were a
means for expressing new discoveries:

"Therefore, in mathematicals the wise wisely sought illustrations of
things that were to be searched out by the intellect. And none of the
ancients who are esteemed as great approached difficult matters by any
other likeness than mathematics....

"Proceeding on this pathway of the ancients, I concur with them and say
that since the pathway for approaching divine matters is opened to us
only through metaphors, we can make quite suitable use of mathematical
signs because of their incorruptible certainty."

Cusa's approach was emphatically anti-Aristotelean. Instead of the
unlimited, linearly extended infinite void, in which geometrical objects
rattled around, devoid of intention, Cusa saw the apparent infinite
merely as the domain of yet to be discovered universal principles, that
bounded the finite and determined the characteristic of action within
it. The characteristics of that set of principles can be discovered by
ascending upward from their finite manifestation towards the higher
expression:

"...when we set out to investigate the Maximum metaphorically, we must
leap beyond simple likeness. For since all mathematicals are finite and
otherwise could not even be imagined; if we want to use finite things as
a way for ascending to the unqualifiedly Maximum, we must first consider
finite mathematical figures together with their characteristics and
relations. Next, we must apply these relations in a transformed way, to
corresponding infinite mathematical figures. Thirdly, we must thereafter
in a still more highly transformed way, apply the relations of these
infinite figures to the simple Infinite, which is altogether independent
even of all figure. At this point our ignorance will be taught
incomprehensibly how we are to think more correctly and truly about the
Most High as we grope by means of a symbolism."

Cusa's approach redefined the self-bounding characteristic of the
Pythagorean sphere. For Cusa, the visible sphere, though apparently
self-bounded, was actually bounded by a higher domain of universal
principles that lay outside the sphere itself. Because the domain of
these principles exists outside the domain of finite physical objects,
it appears, from the finite perspective of the objects, to be infinitely
far away.

Thus, the characteristics of the visible sphere, most importantly for
Cusa, the incommensurability between the spherically curved and the
linearly straight, reflected the higher principle from which the curved
and the straight were both generated. Thus, for Cusa, in opposition to
Aristotle, the curved was not a deviation from straightness. Rather, the
incommensurability between them, reflected one single principle, in
unfolded form. Cusa expressed this relationship by the ironical
juxtaposition of the idea of a finite sphere and line with an
hypothesized infinite one:

"I maintain, therefore, that {if} there were an infinite line, it would
be a straight line, a triangle, a circle and a sphere. And likewise {if}
there were an infinite sphere, it would be a circle, a triangle, and a
line." (emphasis added).

From this standpoint, Cusa redefined the physical expression of
Pythagorean spherics. There are no perfectly circular or spherical
motions in the created world, Cusa correctly insisted. Nor is there
perfect equality in harmonics, statics, or other physical phenomena.
There is no absolute center to the universe, nor is there a single set
of poles. However, this imprecise nature of the physical world does not
indicate its deviation from the false-perfection of the {a priori}
linearly-extended fantasy world of Aristotle's Euclidean-type geometry.
Rather, this imprecision indicated the characteristics of the true
physical-geometry of the universe, which cannot be described by simple
abstract geometrical shapes, but must be discovered by physical
investigations:

"Thereupon you will see through the intellect, to which only learned
ignorance is of help that the world and its motion and shape cannot be
apprehended. For the world will appear as a wheel in a wheel and a
sphere in a sphere having its center and circumference nowhere, as was
stated."

But, the fact that the physical universe cannot be described by simple,
static shapes, does not make it unknowable. It is through this very
imprecision, as projected into the visible domain, (as for example, onto
the Pythagorean sphere) that the true higher ordering principle can be
discovered, as knowledge of the Creator's intention:

"Who would not admire this Artisan, who with regard to the spheres, the
stars, and the regions of the stars used such skill that there is though
without complete precision both a harmony of all things and a diversity
of all things? This Artisan considered in advance the sizes, the
placing, and the motion of the stars in the one world; and He ordained
the distances of the stars in such a way that unless each region were as
it is, it could neither exist nor exist in such a place and with such an
order nor could the universe exist...."

"But all things reply to him, who in learned ignorance asks them what
they are, or in what manner they exist, or for what purpose they
exist..."

On this basis, Kepler, who called Nicholas of Cusa "divine", broke the
centuries-old barrier that had been established by Aristotelean dogma,
and established a new, modern physics not tied to any {a priori}
considerations, but only to physical ones. As Kepler noted in the
opening of his {New Astronomy}, it may be the first presumption of
reason that action in the physical universe is circular, but physical
experiment determined this to be untrue. Consequently, all {a priori}
geometrical descriptions of the motions of the planets, such as those
adopted by Ptolemy, Copernicus, and Brahe must be abandoned in favor of
a physical-geometry based only on physical causes. For Kepler, the
paradoxes among the tracings of the motions of the planetary orbits onto
the celestial sphere provided the clues that led him to discover the
principles that were determining them. Thus, Kepler investigated not the
objects of the sky, nor simply their motions as projected onto the
celestial sphere. Rather, he investigated the relationships between
these projected motions, from which he apprehended the characteristics
of the unseen principles from which those motions were determined.

It is from this standpoint that Kepler was able to elaborate the
harmonics of the non-uniform, essentially elliptical motion of the
planetary orbits, giving an entirely new meaning to the physical
significance of the ancient Pythagorean discoveries concerning the
boundaries of spherical action, such as the five regular solids, conic
sections, and musical harmonics. The question posed by Kepler to all
future generations, was to develop a new type of mathematics that could
express these higher principles. Standing on Leibniz's shoulders, this
is what Gauss and Riemann developed as the complex domain.

The Physical "Shape" of the Universe

As Riemann emphasized in his 1854 habilitation lecture, his
philosophical fragments, and his lectures on Abelian and hypergeometric
functions, and as Gauss had spoken earlier, the common, intuitive
notions concerning geometrical objects presupposes a set of assumptions
concerning the fundamental nature of the "space" in which those objects
arise. Like Cusa, Kepler, and Leibniz before them, both Gauss and
Riemann insisted it was the action of physical principles that
determined the characteristics of what is called "space", not a set of
arbitrary {a priori} assumptions. While these physical principles are
unseen, the effect of their action is measurable.

To express the connection between these measurable effects and the
unseen principles themselves, Gauss and Riemann developed a new form of
spherics, by extending Leibniz's infinitesimal calculus into the complex
domain.

For Gauss this meant rejecting all arbitrary notions of the sphere as a
three-dimensional object bouncing around in an empty, linearly-extended
void. Instead, Gauss considered the sphere to be what Riemann would
later call, a doubly-extended manifold. In this way, Gauss eliminated
from the sphere (and all other doubly-extended manifolds), all arbitrary
ideas of linear extension. Linear distance between any set of points on
the surface is determined solely as a function of angular displacement.
The relationship between angular displacement and linear extension
reflected the effect of an invariant characteristic of the surface. That
characteristic Gauss called "curvature".

By "curvature" Gauss did not mean "not-straight". Gauss's idea of
"curvature" is an expression of the characteristic principles that
determine action on that surface. But, since the characteristic
curvature is not visible, it must be discovered by its effect on all
action on that surface.

For example, the elliptical arc of a planetary orbit is determined by
the harmonic characteristics of the principle of universal gravitation.
To the planet, such an arc is a "straight-line". To our senses the
planet's orbit is a variable arc of a great circle on a sphere. But to
our minds, as Kepler showed, we can discover that those arcs are merely
the projection onto a sphere of an action that is occurring in a
different surface a surface we cannot see. However we can imagine this
other surface, not as a visible image, but as that set of physical
principles which has the power to produce the physical effects whose
visible images are projected onto the celestial sphere. Furthermore,
since we are moving in that surface ourselves, we must apprehend its
characteristic curvature, from within it, by measuring the effect of
that curvature in the relatively infinitesimally small--a method that
Leibniz called "analysis situs".

Gauss's idea of a surface, therefore, is not a simple visible shape but
a manifold of physical principles. To better determine the
characteristics of these manifolds, Gauss developed the means to map
these manifolds onto a sphere. Under these mappings the characteristic
curvature of the unseen surface is expressed as anomalies within the
domain of spherical functions. Working backwards, we can then "unfold"
these projections, to determine the characteristics of the manifold from
which they are projected. (See Riemann for Anti-Dummies Parts 44-46.)

The Riemann Sphere

Armed with Gauss's work, Riemann generalized the method. As indicated in
his fragment on "n-dimensional" manifolds, Riemann considered the
geometrical ideas of line, surface and solid as only special intuitive
examples of a singly, doubly and triply extended manifold, whose modes
of determination are physical principles, not linear extensions.
However, Riemann emphasized as did Gauss, Leibniz, Kepler, Cusa, and
Plato before him, that the construction of the appropriate metaphorical
representation was essential to achieve a greater understanding of these
principles, and to communicate these discoveries to others, so as to
bring them under the willful control of mankind.

Riemann developed these ideas in his lectures on Abelian and
hypergeometric functions, whose deeper implications were not realized
until LaRouche's more advanced, revolutionary breakthroughs in the
science of physical economy.

Riemann's starting point was Gauss's original idea that the physical
characteristics of doubly-extended manifolds, (i.e. surfaces) could be
represented in the complex domain as functions of complex numbers. This
is based on Gauss's idea of representing complex numbers as a function
of position on a surface.

This is {not} the idea of representing complex numbers as points on an
abstract Cartesian grid as is universally taught in reductionist
mathematics education today. We emphasize, as Gauss did, that any
function of position must be in reference to some physically determined
starting point and a physically determined direction. For example, the
determination of position on the celestial sphere, must be in reference
to some starting point (the pole), and some direction (the direction of
the position of sunrise on the vernal equinox). Once these two
parameters (origin and direction) are determined, all other positions on
the surface can be expressed with respect to them. This is distinct from
the Aristotelean, Euclidean, Cartesian, Kantian idea of an
undifferentiated, linearly-extended space. As Gauss pointed out with
reference to Kant, it is impossible to determine anything about the
nature of space except by reference to physical objects. In other words,
Gauss did not begin with a Cartesian-Kantian idea of an empty surface
and then assign some arbitrary origin and direction to it. Rather,
physics establishes the origin and reference direction, which in turn
established the surface.

Riemann showed that once such a physically determined doubly-extended
surface has been established, the characteristics of action within that
surface can be expressed as a complex function. Here again, Riemann
adopted Gauss's approach of the "Copenhagen Prize Essay" on conformal
mappings. For example, the stereographic projection of the sphere onto
the plane is an expression of the complex exponential. [(See Figure
1.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part56_files_part56figure01.gif)

Thus, complex functions considered as conformal mappings, express the
transformation of one surface, with a certain characteristic of action,
into another, with a different characteristic of action.

For pedagogical purposes let us investigate this matter in more detail
with respect to the ancient Pythagorean problem of doubling the square,
as seen from the higher perspective of the complex domain. As Gauss
demonstrated in his new proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra, the
most general expression of an algebraic power is represented
geometrically as a specified change in angle and length. That is,
squaring is expressed by doubling the angle and squaring the length with
respect to that physically determined origin and direction. Cubing is
expressed by tripling the angle and cubing the length, etc. [(See Figure
2.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part56_files_part56figure02.gif)

So, for example, in the simplest case of squaring as a complex function,
a semi-circular pathway will be mapped onto a full circle. [(See Figure

Thus, a complete circle will be mapped onto a complete circle twice.

Since it is impossible, in a Cartesian empty space, to distinguish the
first mapping from the second, Riemann invented the idea of a surface
that has two layers with the second mapping laying on top of the first.
Thus, by squaring, every point on the original surface is transformed
into two different points, one laying directly over the other, on the
"squared" surface. Those points that have only one value (in this
example, the origin), Riemann called a "branch point". [(See Figure
6.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part56_files_part56figure06.gif)
These branch points correspond to physical singularities on the surface
as the characteristic of action with respect to them is different than
the rest of the surface. A surface with no branch points, Riemann
called, "simply-connected"; a surface with one branch point he called
"doubly-connected"; a surface with two branch points he called
"triply-connected", etc.

Riemann emphasized that this type of mapping can not occur in a linear,
infinitely-extended surface, but only in a bounded one. The reader is
encouraged to discover this for yourself. You will discover that it is
impossible to think of transforming one doubly-extended manifold (i.e.
surface) into another without a boundary. Even if the nature and
characteristics of that boundary are not yet determined, its necessary
existence is.

This is another indication of why physical action can only be expressed
in the complex domain, as there is no physical process that is not
bounded. For this reason, Riemann insisted that one could not express
complex functions on a Cartesian plane, but only on a bounded surface,
as represented by what today is called, "The Riemann Sphere". [(See

7.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part56_files_part56figure07.gif)

Now, back to Riemann's surfaces. Riemann confronted the problem that
when a mapping produces a multi-sheeted surface, a paradox results,
because a continuous curve on one surface becomes two separate curves on
two (or more) different layers of the second surface. For this reason he
specified the need for a cut, which he called a "branch-cut" that
extended from the branch points to the boundary. The various layers of
the surface are then connected to one another along these branch cuts,
so that all pathways on one of the layers can be continued onto all the
other layers continuously. (See Figures

On the Riemann sphere, the entire function can be represented because
unlike the Cartesian plane which has no boundary, the Riemann sphere is
bounded. The accompanying animation, [(See Figure
9.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part56_files_part56figure09.gif)
illustrates the squaring function projected onto Riemann's sphere. As
the boundary on the plane extends outward from the origin, its
projection approaches the "north pole" of the sphere. In this example,
the squaring function forms a two-sheeted surface on the sphere, whose
branch cut runs from one pole to the other.

+:----------------------------------------------------------------------+

sphere. Here two closed pathways, one encircling the branch point at the
origin
[(10a.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part56_files_part56figure10a.gif)

Under squaring, the pathway encircling the branch point at the origin
folds over itself and is mapped onto two sheets. The pathway that does
not contain the branch point remains entirely on one layer. [(See Figure
10c.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part56_files_part56figure10c.gif)

However, something is revealed on the Riemann sphere that would
otherwise remain hidden. The sphere reveals the existence of another
branch-point at the north pole, which in the Cartesian plane can only be
considered "the infinite". This can be seen by performing the same
squaring action, but under the inversion that turns the function "inside
out". What was the origin is now the "infinite" and vice versa. [(See
Figure
11.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part56_files_part56figure11.gif)
This has the same effect on closed pathways. Inversion turns the
pathways inside out, which now encircle the branch point at the
"infinite", or the north pole on the sphere. [(See Figure
12.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part56_files_part56figure12.gif)
Just as the branch point at the origin acted as a singularity, so now
does the other branch point, that had been hidden in the "infinite" in
the Cartesian plane, but on the Riemann sphere it is plainly brought
into view.

Beyond the Sphere

On this basis, Riemann was able to demonstrate, using Leibniz's
principle of "analysis situs", that all the essential characteristics of
a complex function, are determined by the relationship of the boundary
to the branching points, or the other singularities.

This discovery was crucial to Riemann's treatment of elliptical and
Abelian functions. As we discussed in previous installments (See Riemann
for Anti-Dummies Parts 49, 52 and 54) these functions, that initially
arose from the investigations of Kepler's elliptical planetary orbits,
express a succession of higher transcendental powers. Riemann
demonstrated, using a method similar to the one used by Gauss in his
proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra, that those complex
functions associated with these higher transcendentals generate surfaces
with two sheets, but with more than the two branch points expressed by
the algebraic, circular, hyperbolic or exponential functions. [(See
Figure
13.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part56_files_part56figure13.gif)
As Riemann showed, each successively higher power, generates a new set
of branch points.

+:----------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

For example, as illustrated in the previous installments, Gauss showed
that the elliptical transcendentals were distinguished from the
circular, hyperbolic, and elliptical, by their double periodicity. [(See
Figure
14.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part56_files_part56figure14.gif)

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Riemann showed that this characteristic, by necessity, produces four
branch points, which require two branch cuts. [(See Figure
15.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part56_files_part56figure15.gif)

A surface with two branch cuts must be doubly connected, as for example
a torus [(See Figure
16.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part56_files_part56figure16.gif)
Thus, each new species of transcendental function is characterized by a
change in the characteristic topology of the surface, from an "n"
connected manifold to an "n+1" connected manifold.

+:----------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

This is the type of transformation associated with the discovery and
application of a new physical principle.

Now looking back from the standpoint of this new type of Riemannian
spherics, we can recognize that the Pythagorean spherics, is only the
simplest type of a succession of self-bounded surfaces of increasingly
higher "connectivity". The provocative question now posed is: What
bounds this succession of self-boundedness?

This same question was posed by Gauss in a different way concerning the
determination of what is the true geometry. In a letter to Olbers on
April 28, 1817, Gauss asserted, like Cusa, that the true geometry could
never be seen directly but must be discovered:

"Perhaps in another life we will come to another insight into the
essence of space, which is now unreachable for us. Until then, one must
not put geometry with arithmetic, purely a priori, but closer to in rank
with mechanics..."

## RIEMANNIAN SPHERICS {#riemannian-spherics-1 style="text-align: left"}

When Carl Friedrich Gauss repeatedly stated his conviction that
Euclidean geometry was not true, his thoughts were connected to the
pre-Euclidean science of the Pythagoreans and Plato. However Gauss's
"{anti}-Euclideanism" was not a mere restatement of its antecedent.
Rather, Gauss, and later Riemann, sublimated the ancient
Egyptian-Pythagorean science of "spherics" with a new spherics, that had
been demanded by Cusa's discovery of transcendental physical action, the
development of Kepler's discovery of the harmonics of elliptical
planetary orbits, and Leibniz's generalization of both, as the universal
principle of least-action.

This is the vantage point from which to gain a firmer grasp of Riemann's
treatment of Abelian and hypergeometric functions.

The relevant characteristics of the Pythagorean concept of spherics are
summarized in the Plato dialogue, named for the astronomer Timaeus, who,
attributing the origin of his discourse to the testimony of wise men
from more ancient times, recounts the nature and creation of the
universe. Timaeus begins by noting that investigations of the created
world must focus on the eternal universal principles from which it is
patterned. Though "apprehensible by reason and thought,", those
principles are, of necessity, reflected in the world's physical form.
Accordingly, when speaking about the physical universe, Timaeus
emphasizes, it is most important to distinguish between the original
principles and their created copy, and one must be careful to recognize
that a simple description of the latter cannot suffice for an
explanation of the former.

"Accordingly, in dealing with a copy and its model, we must affirm that
the accounts given will themselves be akin to the diverse objects which
they serve to explain; those which deal with what is abiding and firm
and discernible by the aid of thought will be abiding and unshakable;
and in so far as it is possible and fitting for statements to be
irrefutable and invincible, they must in no wise fall short thereof;
whereas the accounts of that which is copied after the likeness of that
model, and is itself a likeness, will be analogous thereof and possess
likelihood; for as Being is to Becoming, so is Truth to Belief.
Wherefore, Socrates, if in our treatment of a great host of matters
regarding the Gods and the generation of the Universe we prove unable to
give accounts that are always in all respects self-consistent and
perfectly exact, be not thou surprised; rather we should be content if
we can furnish accounts that are inferior to none in likelihood,
remembering that both I who speak and you who judge are but human
creatures, so that it becomes us to accept the likely account of these
matters and forbear to search beyond it." (29c-d)

Timaeus goes on to say that the Creator, being good, intended for that
goodness to be reflected in the creation and so he endowed it with
intelligence and soul, and brought it into existence as a self moving,
self-subsisting living creature.

"He fashioned it to be One single Whole, compounded of all wholes,
perfect and ageless and unailing. And he bestowed on it the shape which
was befitting and akin. Now for that living creature which is designed
to embrace within itself all living creatures, the fitting shape will be
that which comprises within itself all the shapes there are; wherefore
he wrought it into a round, in the shape of a sphere, equidistant in all
directions from the center to extremities, which of all shapes is the
most perfect and most self-similar, since he deemed that the similar is
infinitely fairer than the dissimilar....

"Such then was the reasoning of the ever-existing God concerning the god
which was one day to become existent, whereby He made it smooth and even
and equal on all sides from the center, a whole and perfect body
compounded of perfect bodies, and in the midst thereof He set soul,
which He stretched throughout the whole of it; therewith He enveloped
also the exterior of its body; and as a circle revolving in a circle He
established one sole and solitary Heaven, able of itself because of its
excellence to company with itself and needing none other beside,
sufficing unto itself an acquaintance and friend. And because of all
this He generated it to be a blessed God.." (34-b.)

This spherical form, Timaeus explains, expresses not only the goodness
and perfection of a universe patterned from reason and intelligence, but
it also expresses the motions of the visible objects in the heavens as
well. These visible objects, whose individual motions trace circular
arcs onto the celestial sphere, form the "moving image of eternity" we
call time. Timaeus proceeds to recount, in detail, the diverse motions
of these celestial objects, the totality of which are visible
expressions of that which is eternal and universal.

But Plato emphasized that these characteristic spherical motions, while
a means to express the characteristics of an idea, cannot, by
themselves, be taken as knowledge of the idea. But, being patterned
after the eternal, their study can aid us in grasping what can only be
apprehended by reason and thought:

"Thus, said I. These sparks that paint the sky, since they are
decorations on a visible surface, we must regard, to be sure, as the
fairest and most exact of material things, but we must recognize that
they fall far short of the truth, of the movements, namely of real speed
and real slowness in true number and in all true figures both in
relation to one another and as vehicles of the things they carry and
contain. These can be apprehended only by reason and thought, but not by
sight, or do you think otherwise?

By no means, he said.

Then, said I, we must use the blazonry of the heavens as patterns to aid
in the study of those realities, just as one would do who chanced upon
diagrams drawn with special care and elaboration by Daedalus or some
other craftsman or painter. For anyone acquainted with geometry who saw
such designs would admit the beauty of the workmanship, but, would think
it absurd to examine them seriously in the expectation of finding in
them the absolute truth with regard to equals or doubles or any other
ratio." (Rep. 529e-530b)

The Boundaries of the Sphere

Because these visible expressions could also mislead reason, Plato
cautioned against the methods of the Sophists and Eleatics, (forerunners
of today's mathematical formalists and information theorists), whose
practice, like their modern counterparts, was to induce insanity in
their victims by restricting their attention to the visible form of
mathematical objects that have been disconnected from the universal
principles from which they arose, and, from the ideas whose shadows they
were intended to represent. As he warned in the {Republic}:

"This at least, said I, will not be disputed by those who have even a
slight acquaintance with geometry (earth-measure), that this science is
in direct contradiction with the language employed in it by its adepts.

How so? he said.

Their language is most ludicrous, though they cannot help it, for they
speak as if they were doing something and as if all their words were
directed toward action. For all their talk is of squaring and applying
the adding and the like, whereas in fact the real object of the entire
study is pure knowledge.

This is absolutely true, he said.

And must we not agree on a further point?

What?

That it is the knowledge of that which always is, and not of a something
which at some time comes into being and passes away.

That is readily admitted, he said, for geometry is the knowledge of the
eternally existent." (Rep. 527a.)

The Sophists insisted that geometry could state nothing truthful
concerning "knowledge about that which always is" because geometrical
objects, being objects of sense, lie in the domain of that which is
always changing. Consequently for the sophist, geometrical objects, like
all other objects of sense, could be connected to each other by a set of
formal rules, described and manipulated, but such actions were {by
definition} divorced from the eternal physical principles governing the
universe itself. By limiting scientific inquiry to such objects of sense
perception, as Aristotle also maintained, the Sophists could awe their
audiences with dazzling demonstrations, such as the simultaneous
existence and non-existence of the one and the many, while convincing
them that knowledge of universal principles was, in the end, beyond
their grasp.

By contrast, the Pythagorean-Platonic scientists admitted no objects
into geometry that did not arise in connection with an effort to grasp
an unseen, eternal, universal principle. Such objects, such as the
Pythagorean concept of the sphere, were brought into existence by an
action of a mind intending to gain greater mastery over the principles
that govern the universe itself. Consequently for these Socratics, all
such geometrical objects are representations of ideas that are
apprehensible only by reason and thought. "Thought-objects" so generated
contain within them, the essential characteristics of the universal
principles they are intended to grasp. Being thus connected to universal
principles, paradoxes generated by the investigation of such objects,
point to the existence of unknown principles, that, once discovered,
lead to the generation of new ideas, that demand new types of
geometrical expression.

In the science of Classical Greece, this is exemplified by the
uniqueness of the five regular solids. Nothing in the smooth, everywhere
same, form of a sphere gives any indication of the existence of a
bounding principle that determines that there be five, and only five,
unique solids that equally divide that everywhere constant surface. But,
the fact that only five such solids can be constructed, reveals the
existence, and reflects the characteristics, of that bounding principle.
Thus, even though the sphere is the shape "that comprises all shapes",
the five regular solids indicate the existence of a still higher
principle from which the sphere's power is derived. This higher power,
though outside the visible boundary of the sphere, is, nevertheless,
expressed on the sphere's surface, by the uniqueness of the five regular
solids.

That that higher principle can be found only by surpassing the
boundaries of the sphere, was already evident to the Pythagoreans, as
indicated by Archytas's construction for the doubling of the cube by the
intersection of a torus, cylinder and cone. This stands in contrast to
the doubling of the square, whose generating principle can be expressed
by circular action existing within the same manifold (plane) in which
the square itself is generated. On the other hand, the cube, which is
formed in the sphere, cannot be doubled by means of spherical action. As
Archytas demonstrated, a more complex unfolding of the sphere is
required. Thus, the characteristic of the cube, as well as the other
four regular solids, indicated to the Pythagoreans and Plato, the
existence of a still higher principle that bounds the apparently
self-bounded spherical form.

Because of paradoxes like these, Plato insisted that the study of these
solids should be emphasized, in addition to the Pythagorean quadrivium
of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music, in the education of
political leaders, so that those leaders could develop the cognitive
powers to recognize universal principles and act only on the basis of
truth, not on the basis of arbitrary opinion.

For opposing reasons, Aristotle introduced the arbitrary fiction that
the form of the universe is an unbounded, empty, linearly extended void,
as codified in the Elements of Euclid. Under this scheme, spherical
action is not the reflection of the universal principles from which it
is generated. It is but only one, of infinitely many undifferentiated
possible types of action. For Euclid, the sphere's existence, like the
rest of the objects of Euclidean geometry, rests only on the authority
of an {a priori} set of definitions, axioms and postulates. For Euclid,
and those indoctrinated by sophism, empiricism, etc. this false, fantasy
world of linear action becomes the only true one from which all physical
processes deviate.

Ironically, the Pythagorean-Platonic method expressed as self-bounded
spherical action reflects the unlimited potential for the discovery of
new physical principles, because the existence of these new principles
is indicated through the emergence of paradoxes, such as the uniqueness
of the five regular solids. On the other hand, the
Aristotelean-Euclidean fantasy of an apparently unbounded, linearly
extended void, that, {by definition}, permits no physical principles
within its midst, acts as a barrier to the introduction of new ideas,
restricting human knowledge to a definite and finite domain: a barrier
that held back human progress for nearly 1500 years, from the murder of
Archimedes in 231 B.C. until the dawn of the European Renaissance in the
14th century.

In sum: the self-bounded is unlimited potential; the unbounded is
forever constrained.

Surpassing the Boundaries of the Self-Bounded Sphere

The Aristotelean barrier was cracked when Nicholas of Cusa re-introduced
the Pythagorean-Platonic concept of spherics, in the new, more advanced
form of his method of "On Learned Ignorance". Like his forerunners, Cusa
understood that mathematical objects, generated as metaphors, were a
means for expressing new discoveries:

"Therefore, in mathematicals the wise wisely sought illustrations of
things that were to be searched out by the intellect. And none of the
ancients who are esteemed as great approached difficult matters by any
other likeness than mathematics....

"Proceeding on this pathway of the ancients, I concur with them and say
that since the pathway for approaching divine matters is opened to us
only through metaphors, we can make quite suitable use of mathematical
signs because of their incorruptible certainty."

Cusa's approach was emphatically anti-Aristotelean. Instead of the
unlimited, linearly extended infinite void, in which geometrical objects
rattled around, devoid of intention, Cusa saw the apparent infinite
merely as the domain of yet to be discovered universal principles, that
bounded the finite and determined the characteristic of action within
it. The characteristics of that set of principles can be discovered by
ascending upward from their finite manifestation towards the higher
expression:

"...when we set out to investigate the Maximum metaphorically, we must
leap beyond simple likeness. For since all mathematicals are finite and
otherwise could not even be imagined; if we want to use finite things as
a way for ascending to the unqualifiedly Maximum, we must first consider
finite mathematical figures together with their characteristics and
relations. Next, we must apply these relations in a transformed way, to
corresponding infinite mathematical figures. Thirdly, we must thereafter
in a still more highly transformed way, apply the relations of these
infinite figures to the simple Infinite, which is altogether independent
even of all figure. At this point our ignorance will be taught
incomprehensibly how we are to think more correctly and truly about the
Most High as we grope by means of a symbolism."

Cusa's approach redefined the self-bounding characteristic of the
Pythagorean sphere. For Cusa, the visible sphere, though apparently
self-bounded, was actually bounded by a higher domain of universal
principles that lay outside the sphere itself. Because the domain of
these principles exists outside the domain of finite physical objects,
it appears, from the finite perspective of the objects, to be infinitely
far away.

Thus, the characteristics of the visible sphere, most importantly for
Cusa, the incommensurability between the spherically curved and the
linearly straight, reflected the higher principle from which the curved
and the straight were both generated. Thus, for Cusa, in opposition to
Aristotle, the curved was not a deviation from straightness. Rather, the
incommensurability between them, reflected one single principle, in
unfolded form. Cusa expressed this relationship by the ironical
juxtaposition of the idea of a finite sphere and line with an
hypothesized infinite one:

"I maintain, therefore, that {if} there were an infinite line, it would
be a straight line, a triangle, a circle and a sphere. And likewise {if}
there were an infinite sphere, it would be a circle, a triangle, and a
line." (emphasis added).

From this standpoint, Cusa redefined the physical expression of
Pythagorean spherics. There are no perfectly circular or spherical
motions in the created world, Cusa correctly insisted. Nor is there
perfect equality in harmonics, statics, or other physical phenomena.
There is no absolute center to the universe, nor is there a single set
of poles. However, this imprecise nature of the physical world does not
indicate its deviation from the false-perfection of the {a priori}
linearly-extended fantasy world of Aristotle's Euclidean-type geometry.
Rather, this imprecision indicated the characteristics of the true
physical-geometry of the universe, which cannot be described by simple
abstract geometrical shapes, but must be discovered by physical
investigations:

"Thereupon you will see through the intellect, to which only learned
ignorance is of help that the world and its motion and shape cannot be
apprehended. For the world will appear as a wheel in a wheel and a
sphere in a sphere having its center and circumference nowhere, as was
stated."

But, the fact that the physical universe cannot be described by simple,
static shapes, does not make it unknowable. It is through this very
imprecision, as projected into the visible domain, (as for example, onto
the Pythagorean sphere) that the true higher ordering principle can be
discovered, as knowledge of the Creator's intention:

"Who would not admire this Artisan, who with regard to the spheres, the
stars, and the regions of the stars used such skill that there is though
without complete precision both a harmony of all things and a diversity
of all things? This Artisan considered in advance the sizes, the
placing, and the motion of the stars in the one world; and He ordained
the distances of the stars in such a way that unless each region were as
it is, it could neither exist nor exist in such a place and with such an
order nor could the universe exist...."

"But all things reply to him, who in learned ignorance asks them what
they are, or in what manner they exist, or for what purpose they
exist..."

On this basis, Kepler, who called Nicholas of Cusa "divine", broke the
centuries-old barrier that had been established by Aristotelean dogma,
and established a new, modern physics not tied to any {a priori}
considerations, but only to physical ones. As Kepler noted in the
opening of his {New Astronomy}, it may be the first presumption of
reason that action in the physical universe is circular, but physical
experiment determined this to be untrue. Consequently, all {a priori}
geometrical descriptions of the motions of the planets, such as those
adopted by Ptolemy, Copernicus, and Brahe must be abandoned in favor of
a physical-geometry based only on physical causes. For Kepler, the
paradoxes among the tracings of the motions of the planetary orbits onto
the celestial sphere provided the clues that led him to discover the
principles that were determining them. Thus, Kepler investigated not the
objects of the sky, nor simply their motions as projected onto the
celestial sphere. Rather, he investigated the relationships between
these projected motions, from which he apprehended the characteristics
of the unseen principles from which those motions were determined.

It is from this standpoint that Kepler was able to elaborate the
harmonics of the non-uniform, essentially elliptical motion of the
planetary orbits, giving an entirely new meaning to the physical
significance of the ancient Pythagorean discoveries concerning the
boundaries of spherical action, such as the five regular solids, conic
sections, and musical harmonics. The question posed by Kepler to all
future generations, was to develop a new type of mathematics that could
express these higher principles. Standing on Leibniz's shoulders, this
is what Gauss and Riemann developed as the complex domain.

The Physical "Shape" of the Universe

As Riemann emphasized in his 1854 habilitation lecture, his
philosophical fragments, and his lectures on Abelian and hypergeometric
functions, and as Gauss had spoken earlier, the common, intuitive
notions concerning geometrical objects presupposes a set of assumptions
concerning the fundamental nature of the "space" in which those objects
arise. Like Cusa, Kepler, and Leibniz before them, both Gauss and
Riemann insisted it was the action of physical principles that
determined the characteristics of what is called "space", not a set of
arbitrary {a priori} assumptions. While these physical principles are
unseen, the effect of their action is measurable.

To express the connection between these measurable effects and the
unseen principles themselves, Gauss and Riemann developed a new form of
spherics, by extending Leibniz's infinitesimal calculus into the complex
domain.

For Gauss this meant rejecting all arbitrary notions of the sphere as a
three-dimensional object bouncing around in an empty, linearly-extended
void. Instead, Gauss considered the sphere to be what Riemann would
later call, a doubly-extended manifold. In this way, Gauss eliminated
from the sphere (and all other doubly-extended manifolds), all arbitrary
ideas of linear extension. Linear distance between any set of points on
the surface is determined solely as a function of angular displacement.
The relationship between angular displacement and linear extension
reflected the effect of an invariant characteristic of the surface. That
characteristic Gauss called "curvature".

By "curvature" Gauss did not mean "not-straight". Gauss's idea of
"curvature" is an expression of the characteristic principles that
determine action on that surface. But, since the characteristic
curvature is not visible, it must be discovered by its effect on all
action on that surface.

For example, the elliptical arc of a planetary orbit is determined by
the harmonic characteristics of the principle of universal gravitation.
To the planet, such an arc is a "straight-line". To our senses the
planet's orbit is a variable arc of a great circle on a sphere. But to
our minds, as Kepler showed, we can discover that those arcs are merely
the projection onto a sphere of an action that is occurring in a
different surface a surface we cannot see. However we can imagine this
other surface, not as a visible image, but as that set of physical
principles which has the power to produce the physical effects whose
visible images are projected onto the celestial sphere. Furthermore,
since we are moving in that surface ourselves, we must apprehend its
characteristic curvature, from within it, by measuring the effect of
that curvature in the relatively infinitesimally small--a method that
Leibniz called "analysis situs".

Gauss's idea of a surface, therefore, is not a simple visible shape but
a manifold of physical principles. To better determine the
characteristics of these manifolds, Gauss developed the means to map
these manifolds onto a sphere. Under these mappings the characteristic
curvature of the unseen surface is expressed as anomalies within the
domain of spherical functions. Working backwards, we can then "unfold"
these projections, to determine the characteristics of the manifold from
which they are projected. (See Riemann for Anti-Dummies Parts 44-46.)

The Riemann Sphere

Armed with Gauss's work, Riemann generalized the method. As indicated in
his fragment on "n-dimensional" manifolds, Riemann considered the
geometrical ideas of line, surface and solid as only special intuitive
examples of a singly, doubly and triply extended manifold, whose modes
of determination are physical principles, not linear extensions.
However, Riemann emphasized as did Gauss, Leibniz, Kepler, Cusa, and
Plato before him, that the construction of the appropriate metaphorical
representation was essential to achieve a greater understanding of these
principles, and to communicate these discoveries to others, so as to
bring them under the willful control of mankind.

Riemann developed these ideas in his lectures on Abelian and
hypergeometric functions, whose deeper implications were not realized
until LaRouche's more advanced, revolutionary breakthroughs in the
science of physical economy.

Riemann's starting point was Gauss's original idea that the physical
characteristics of doubly-extended manifolds, (i.e. surfaces) could be
represented in the complex domain as functions of complex numbers. This
is based on Gauss's idea of representing complex numbers as a function
of position on a surface.

This is {not} the idea of representing complex numbers as points on an
abstract Cartesian grid as is universally taught in reductionist
mathematics education today. We emphasize, as Gauss did, that any
function of position must be in reference to some physically determined
starting point and a physically determined direction. For example, the
determination of position on the celestial sphere, must be in reference
to some starting point (the pole), and some direction (the direction of
the position of sunrise on the vernal equinox). Once these two
parameters (origin and direction) are determined, all other positions on
the surface can be expressed with respect to them. This is distinct from
the Aristotelean, Euclidean, Cartesian, Kantian idea of an
undifferentiated, linearly-extended space. As Gauss pointed out with
reference to Kant, it is impossible to determine anything about the
nature of space except by reference to physical objects. In other words,
Gauss did not begin with a Cartesian-Kantian idea of an empty surface
and then assign some arbitrary origin and direction to it. Rather,
physics establishes the origin and reference direction, which in turn
established the surface.

Riemann showed that once such a physically determined doubly-extended
surface has been established, the characteristics of action within that
surface can be expressed as a complex function. Here again, Riemann
adopted Gauss's approach of the "Copenhagen Prize Essay" on conformal
mappings. For example, the stereographic projection of the sphere onto
the plane is an expression of the complex exponential. [(See Figure
1.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part56_files_part56figure01.gif)

Thus, complex functions considered as conformal mappings, express the
transformation of one surface, with a certain characteristic of action,
into another, with a different characteristic of action.

For pedagogical purposes let us investigate this matter in more detail
with respect to the ancient Pythagorean problem of doubling the square,
as seen from the higher perspective of the complex domain. As Gauss
demonstrated in his new proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra, the
most general expression of an algebraic power is represented
geometrically as a specified change in angle and length. That is,
squaring is expressed by doubling the angle and squaring the length with
respect to that physically determined origin and direction. Cubing is
expressed by tripling the angle and cubing the length, etc. [(See Figure
2.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part56_files_part56figure02.gif)

So, for example, in the simplest case of squaring as a complex function,
a semi-circular pathway will be mapped onto a full circle. [(See Figure

Transforming an entire surface in this way, thus maps half the original
surface on top of the other. [(See Figure

Since it is impossible, in a Cartesian empty space, to distinguish the
first mapping from the second, Riemann invented the idea of a surface
that has two layers with the second mapping laying on top of the first.
Thus, by squaring, every point on the original surface is transformed
into two different points, one laying directly over the other, on the
"squared" surface. Those points that have only one value (in this
example, the origin), Riemann called a "branch point". [(See Figure
6.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part56_files_part56figure06.gif)
These branch points correspond to physical singularities on the surface
as the characteristic of action with respect to them is different than
the rest of the surface. A surface with no branch points, Riemann
called, "simply-connected"; a surface with one branch point he called
"doubly-connected"; a surface with two branch points he called
"triply-connected", etc.

Riemann emphasized that this type of mapping can not occur in a linear,
infinitely-extended surface, but only in a bounded one. The reader is
encouraged to discover this for yourself. You will discover that it is
impossible to think of transforming one doubly-extended manifold (i.e.
surface) into another without a boundary. Even if the nature and
characteristics of that boundary are not yet determined, its necessary
existence is.

This is another indication of why physical action can only be expressed
in the complex domain, as there is no physical process that is not
bounded. For this reason, Riemann insisted that one could not express
complex functions on a Cartesian plane, but only on a bounded surface,
as represented by what today is called, "The Riemann Sphere". [(See

Now, back to Riemann's surfaces. Riemann confronted the problem that
when a mapping produces a multi-sheeted surface, a paradox results,
because a continuous curve on one surface becomes two separate curves on
two (or more) different layers of the second surface. For this reason he
specified the need for a cut, which he called a "branch-cut" that
extended from the branch points to the boundary. The various layers of
the surface are then connected to one another along these branch cuts,
so that all pathways on one of the layers can be continued onto all the
other layers continuously. (See Figures

On the Riemann sphere, the entire function can be represented because
unlike the Cartesian plane which has no boundary, the Riemann sphere is
bounded. The accompanying animation, [(See Figure
9.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part56_files_part56figure09.gif)
illustrates the squaring function projected onto Riemann's sphere. As
the boundary on the plane extends outward from the origin, its
projection approaches the "north pole" of the sphere. In this example,
the squaring function forms a two-sheeted surface on the sphere, whose
branch cut runs from one pole to the other.

+:----------------------------------------------------------------------+

These animations illustrate the action of the singularity on the Riemann
sphere. Here two closed pathways, one encircling the branch point at the
origin

Under squaring, the pathway encircling the branch point at the origin
folds over itself and is mapped onto two sheets. The pathway that does
not contain the branch point remains entirely on one layer. [(See Figure
10c.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part56_files_part56figure10c.gif)

However, something is revealed on the Riemann sphere that would
otherwise remain hidden. The sphere reveals the existence of another
branch-point at the north pole, which in the Cartesian plane can only be
considered "the infinite". This can be seen by performing the same
squaring action, but under the inversion that turns the function "inside
out". What was the origin is now the "infinite" and vice versa. [(See
Figure
11.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part56_files_part56figure11.gif)
This has the same effect on closed pathways. Inversion turns the
pathways inside out, which now encircle the branch point at the
"infinite", or the north pole on the sphere. [(See Figure
12.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part56_files_part56figure12.gif)
Just as the branch point at the origin acted as a singularity, so now
does the other branch point, that had been hidden in the "infinite" in
the Cartesian plane, but on the Riemann sphere it is plainly brought
into view.

Beyond the Sphere

On this basis, Riemann was able to demonstrate, using Leibniz's
principle of "analysis situs", that all the essential characteristics of
a complex function, are determined by the relationship of the boundary
to the branching points, or the other singularities.

This discovery was crucial to Riemann's treatment of elliptical and
Abelian functions. As we discussed in previous installments (See Riemann
for Anti-Dummies Parts 49, 52 and 54) these functions, that initially
arose from the investigations of Kepler's elliptical planetary orbits,
express a succession of higher transcendental powers. Riemann
demonstrated, using a method similar to the one used by Gauss in his
proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra, that those complex
functions associated with these higher transcendentals generate surfaces
with two sheets, but with more than the two branch points expressed by
the algebraic, circular, hyperbolic or exponential functions. [(See
Figure
13.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part56_files_part56figure13.gif)
As Riemann showed, each successively higher power, generates a new set
of branch points.

+:----------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

For example, as illustrated in the previous installments, Gauss showed
that the elliptical transcendentals were distinguished from the
circular, hyperbolic, and elliptical, by their double periodicity. [(See
Figure
14.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part56_files_part56figure14.gif)

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Riemann showed that this characteristic, by necessity, produces four
branch points, which require two branch cuts. [(See Figure
15.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part56_files_part56figure15.gif)

|                                                                       |

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

A surface with two branch cuts must be doubly connected, as for example
a torus [(See Figure
16.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part56_files_part56figure16.gif)
Thus, each new species of transcendental function is characterized by a
change in the characteristic topology of the surface, from an "n"
connected manifold to an "n+1" connected manifold.

+:----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Figure 16**                                                         |

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

This is the type of transformation associated with the discovery and
application of a new physical principle.

Now looking back from the standpoint of this new type of Riemannian
spherics, we can recognize that the Pythagorean spherics, is only the
simplest type of a succession of self-bounded surfaces of increasingly
higher "connectivity". The provocative question now posed is: What
bounds this succession of self-boundedness?

This same question was posed by Gauss in a different way concerning the
determination of what is the true geometry. In a letter to Olbers on
April 28, 1817, Gauss asserted, like Cusa, that the true geometry could
never be seen directly but must be discovered:

"Perhaps in another life we will come to another insight into the
essence of space, which is now unreachable for us. Until then, one must
not put geometry with arithmetic, purely a priori, but closer to in rank
with mechanics..."
