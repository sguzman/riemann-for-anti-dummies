Riemann for Anti-Dummies Part 46

SOMETHING IS ROTTEN IN THE STATE OF GEOMETRY

When Gauss issued his 1799 doctoral dissertation on the fundamental
theorem of algebra, he had much more in mind than just proving that
particular theorem. He was creating the foundation for a mathematics
that rested only on physical principles. He chose the domain of algebra,
because that's where his enemy was weakest. The algebraists, Euler,
Lagrange, and D'Alembert, had boasted that they had "freed" mathematics
from the paradoxes of geometry and, like their modern counterparts, the
information theorists, had reduced even the most complicated problems
down to a finite set of rules, definitions and procedures. This was the
oligarch's dream. The feudalist elite was constantly confronted with the
dilemma that to stay in power they must rule over stupid people. But,
the principles of physical economy would always intervene to bring about
the destruction of any society that failed to value human creativity.
The method of Newton, Euler, D'Alembert and Lagrange, a variation of an
old Babylonian trick, offered the prospect of maintaining the world in a
state of perpetual stupidity, while a small group of magicians
(algebraists) kept things orderly.

Gauss showed that what Euler, Lagrange and D'Alembert considered their
strength--the ability to plug holes in their system with a new
definition based solely on their authority--was its weakness. Just as
his teacher Kaestner had done with respect to the parallel postulate of
Euclid, Gauss demonstrated that the square root of minus 1, was not the
imaginary fiction Euler had defined it to be, but was the spirit of the
physical universe come to haunt the algebraic system. Algebra, like the
oligarchical system, could not solve its fundamental problem. It must
yield to physical geometry, and the algebraists, to the creative
scientist.

By the time Gauss was writing his 1799 dissertation, he had already
begun the process of constructing a physical geometry based on
measurement. As soon as he arrived at Goettingen in 1795, he borrowed
one of the university's theodolites and spent many hours measuring out
triangles on the Earth. Some of his early notebook entries show him
constructing a physical geometry from these measurements without resort
to the axioms, definitions and postulates of Euclidean geometry. A
quarter century later, when Gauss undertook to survey the entire Kingdom
of Hannover, many of his colleagues were shocked that someone of his
stature would undertake a project they considered pedestrian. Yet, Gauss
saw in this undertaking, the chance to further his youthful efforts to
construct a physical geometry based on measurement. This work was
brought to fruition in his published papers on curvature, mapping and
geodesy, the which provided the foundation for Riemann's development of
complex functions.

The past two segments of this series have dealt with some of the ideas
developed by Gauss in his "General Investigations of Curved Surfaces"
,which established the principles of what, today, is called,
"differential geometry". Before turning to the more universal
applications of Gauss' geodetic investigations, it is advisable to
review a principle of Leibniz' calculus through the example of the
catenary.

The determination of the catenary, as the shape formed by a hanging
chain, required the discovery of a physical principle that, like the
square root of minus 1, was outside the rules, definitions and
procedures of Euclidean geometry, and outside the domain of
sense-perception. Leibniz and Bernoulli determined that, while that
physical principle could not be known by some a priori rule, it could be
discovered from the way it expressed itself in the smallest parts of the
chain.

To illustrate this, the reader should perform the pedagogical experiment
described by Bernoulli in his text on the integral calculus. Take a
string and tie a light weight to the middle of it. Take one end of the
string in each hand and let the weight hang freely between them. As you
pull your hands apart, you will feel an increase of force exerted on
your hands by the weight. If you lift one hand higher than the other,
the force on the raised hand increases, while the force on the lower
hand decreases.

To simulate the action that produces the catenary, now hold the string
in each hand very close to the weight. Move one hand so that it pulls
the weight away from the other, while allowing the string to slide
through both hands. As you do this, keep the segment of the string that
connects the weight with the stationary hand horizontal. (This simulates
the lowest point on the catenary.) To do this, you will have to
constantly raise the moving hand. The farther your hands are separated,
the faster the moving hand must be raised in order for the opposite
segment to remain horizontal. The curve traced out by the moving hand
will be the catenary.

The reason for performing the above described experiment, is to realize
that the catenary curve is physically determined. In order to keep one
of the string segments horizontal, the moving hand is compelled, by a
physical principle, to follow the catenary curve. The curve is not seen,
but its effects are "felt" by the moving hand, at every small interval
of action. That infinitesimal expression of the catenary principle,
Leibniz called the "differential".

These effects can be measured by the increasing length of the curve for
equal amounts of horizontal motion. In other words, when the hands first
start to move apart, the moving hand only has to be raised a little to
counteract the force of the weight. But as the moving hand moves further
out, the amount of vertical "lift" for small horizontal increments,
increases, which in turn, increases the length of the curve for
corresponding horizontal motion. [(See Figure
1.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part46_files_part46figure01.gif)

(Warning to those indoctrinated in Cartesian geometry: The horizontal
and vertical here are not Cartesian axes, but directions of motion,
physically determined with respect to the direction of the pull of
gravity.)

In the hanging chain this action happens all at once. The horizontal and
vertical are not simply directions of motion, they are the physically
determined boundaries at which the catenary ceases to exist. The curve
of the catenary unfolds as the path of least action between these two
extremes. Its length per unit of action increases as it nears the
vertical extreme, and decreases towards the horizontal. Since the length
of the curve is a direct function of the physical principle governing
the chain's action, it is an appropriate measure of that principle.

Gauss' geodetical investigations led him to extend Leibniz' calculus
into a higher domain.

All measurements of the Heavens and the Earth are made with respect to a
physically determined direction, as indicated by the direction of a free
hanging weight on a string, called a plumb bob. The surface of the Earth
is that surface that is everywhere perpendicular to the direction of the
plumb bob. The question Gauss investigated in his geodesy, is, " What is
the nature of this surface?" Since it were impossible to know the answer
from sense perception, Gauss determined the overall nature of the
surface of the Earth from small (differential) changes in action
measured on it.

To begin to grasp Gauss' idea, begin with the simpler case of the
celestial sphere. This sphere can be entirely determined by two angles,
one around the circle of the horizon, and one from the horizon to the
pole. These two angles define an orthogonal network of circles, which,
for pedagogical purposes, we will call latitude and longitude. The
longitudinal circles are great circles, which are what Gauss called
"geodesics" or shortest lines, while the latitudinal circles are not.

While these circles are always orthogonal to each other, nevertheless,
their relationships change, depending on where they are on the sphere.
As the longitudinal lines get closer to the poles, they get closer
together. Thus, the length of an arc of a circle of latitude between two
determined arcs of longitude changes, depending on its position with
respect to the poles. For example, the distance along the arcs of
latitude between two arcs of longitude separated by 10 degrees, will
decrease, as the latitudes get closer to the poles.

Now, compare that with a spheroid. Here, the lines of longitude are
elliptical, and the lines of latitude are circular. In this case, the
length of the arcs of latitude between two determined arcs of longitude
still get smaller as they approach the poles, but also, the length of
the arcs of longitude between any two determined arcs of latitude get
{longer} as they approach the poles. [(See Figure
3.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part46_files_part46figure03.gif)

This characteristic can be measured in a geodetic survey, by measuring
the lines of latitude as angular changes in the inclination of the north
star. If the Earth were a sphere, equal angular changes will correspond
to equal changes in length of the geodesic longitudinal lines. If these
geodesic lines get longer, with equal angular inclinations of the north
star, then the Earth is spheroidal. What the specific measurements of
that spheroid are, cannot be known by a priori mathematical methods, but
require more refined physical measurements, as developed by Gauss.

Now, look at an ellipsoid. Here the lengths of the lines of latitude
between any two determined lines of longitude, change, both as they
approach the poles, and as they move around in the "equatorial"
direction as well. Additionally, the lengths of the lines of longitude
between any determined lines of latitude, increase as they approach the
poles. [(See Figure
4.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part46_files_part46figure04.gif)

(Note: The accompanying computer generated graphics are supplied merely
to illustrate the text. The reader is strongly encouraged to make
physical demonstrations on real surfaces approximating these shapes. The
reader is also encouraged to experiment with wildly irregular shapes as
well.)

Gauss recognized this characteristic of change as a new type of
"differential", which, for pedagogical purposes, I will call "surface
differentials". Like Leibniz' differentials, these surface differentials
express how the overall principle of action of the surface is manifest
in every small part. However, instead of directly characterizing the
least-action pathways, i.e. geodesics, these "surface differentials"
characterize the changing nature of the principles through which the
least- action pathways unfold. In other words, the surface differential
expresses the characteristic of change of the principles that determine
the characteristics of change of all possible least-action pathways,
i.e. geodesics, on that surface.

To get an intuitive sense of this idea, think of these surface
differentials being approximated by small "rectangular" patches of the
surface. (See [Figure
5](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part46_files_part46figure05.gif)
, [Figure

, and [Figure
7](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part46_files/part46figure07) ). Notice
how the shape of these patches changes, as their positions change on the
different surfaces.

Gauss determined that the relationship between these surface
differentials and the characteristic geodesic lines of the surface could
be measured, because even though these geodesic lines are always the
shortest distance between two points on the surface, the length of the
geodesic with respect to the surface differential changes, according to
the overall curvature of the surface.

Gauss established the relationship between the surface differential and
the characteristic curvature of the changing geodesic line, as a
generalization of the Pythagorean relationship between the diagonal and
the side of the square or rectangle. In the case of a flat plane, (or
surface of zero-curvature, as Gauss would see it), the relationship of
the diagonal to the side of a square (or rectangle), expresses the power
that generates areas, as distinct from the power that generates lines.
Thus, the line that forms the diagonal of the square is a different type
of line than that line which forms the side of the square, because it is
generated by a higher power. This relationship can be measured by the
relationship of the length of the diagonal, to the lengths of the sides
of the square or rectangle. The common expression for this "Pythagorean"
relationship is that the length of the diagonal is equal to the square
root of the sum of the squares of the sides of the square or rectangle.

This "Pythagorean" relationship, Gauss showed, was just a special case
of a more general principle. On a curved surface, the sides of the
square are the constantly changing "sides" of the surface differential,
and the diagonal is the geodesic. The principle that governs the
constantly changing lengths of the "sides" of the surface differential
is a function of the curvature of the surface, which, in turn, is
reflected in the changing length of the geodesic diagonal. Consequently,
the overall curvature of the surface is reflected in the smallest parts
of the geodesic. From this Gauss devised a more general idea of the
"Pythagorean", in which the lengths of the "sides" of the surface
differential are multiplied by a function that characterizes the
physical curvature of the surface. As the surface differential changes
according to the curvature of the surface, the length of the geodesic
diagonal changes accordingly. (A future pedagogical will illustrate,
geometrically, Gauss' idea.)

To get an intuitive sense of this concept, look again at figures 5, 6,
and 7. Imagine the diagonals of each surface differential. Imagine how
the lengths of these diagonals change with the position of the surface
differential. Now conduct a similar investigation on the physical
surfaces you experimented with earlier. Draw on these surfaces geodesic
diagonals to the orthogonal curves you previously drew. This can be done
by holding a string taught between opposite corners of each
"rectangular" patch, and tracing the string path with a marker. Notice
the changes in length and direction of these diagonal's geodesic as the
curvature of the surface changes.

Now, look at a concrete example with respect to the physics of
navigation. On a flat surface draw a grid of orthogonal lines. Draw a
diagonal line that cuts all the vertical lines at the same angle. This
will produce a straight line. [(See Figure
8.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part46_files_part46figure08.gif)
Now try the same thing on a sphere. That is draw a series of geodesic
lines that cut the lines of longitude at a constant angle. The result is
not a straight line, but a spiral like curve called a "loxodrome" [(See
Figure
9.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part46_files_part46figure09.gif)
A navigator who has not mastered the principles of curvature, will find
himself getting farther and farther from his destination, and closer and
closer to the north pole!

From this relationship, Gauss showed that it were possible to discover
the surface differential, and thus the characteristic curvature of the
surface, by measuring small variations in the length of geodesic lines.
For example, in determining the length of the geodesic line that
connected his observatory in Goettingen with Schumacher's in Altona,
Gauss measured a 16 seconds of an arc deviation from what that length
should be if the Earth were a spheroid. That led Gauss to prove that the
shape of the Earth could not conform to any a priori geometric shape,
but was being determined by the physical characteristics of the Earth's
matter and its motion.

Riemann for Anti-Dummies Part 46

SOMETHING IS ROTTEN IN THE STATE OF GEOMETRY

When Gauss issued his 1799 doctoral dissertation on the fundamental
theorem of algebra, he had much more in mind than just proving that
particular theorem. He was creating the foundation for a mathematics
that rested only on physical principles. He chose the domain of algebra,
because that's where his enemy was weakest. The algebraists, Euler,
Lagrange, and D'Alembert, had boasted that they had "freed" mathematics
from the paradoxes of geometry and, like their modern counterparts, the
information theorists, had reduced even the most complicated problems
down to a finite set of rules, definitions and procedures. This was the
oligarch's dream. The feudalist elite was constantly confronted with the
dilemma that to stay in power they must rule over stupid people. But,
the principles of physical economy would always intervene to bring about
the destruction of any society that failed to value human creativity.
The method of Newton, Euler, D'Alembert and Lagrange, a variation of an
old Babylonian trick, offered the prospect of maintaining the world in a
state of perpetual stupidity, while a small group of magicians
(algebraists) kept things orderly.

Gauss showed that what Euler, Lagrange and D'Alembert considered their
strength--the ability to plug holes in their system with a new
definition based solely on their authority--was its weakness. Just as
his teacher Kaestner had done with respect to the parallel postulate of
Euclid, Gauss demonstrated that the square root of minus 1, was not the
imaginary fiction Euler had defined it to be, but was the spirit of the
physical universe come to haunt the algebraic system. Algebra, like the
oligarchical system, could not solve its fundamental problem. It must
yield to physical geometry, and the algebraists, to the creative
scientist.

By the time Gauss was writing his 1799 dissertation, he had already
begun the process of constructing a physical geometry based on
measurement. As soon as he arrived at Goettingen in 1795, he borrowed
one of the university's theodolites and spent many hours measuring out
triangles on the Earth. Some of his early notebook entries show him
constructing a physical geometry from these measurements without resort
to the axioms, definitions and postulates of Euclidean geometry. A
quarter century later, when Gauss undertook to survey the entire Kingdom
of Hannover, many of his colleagues were shocked that someone of his
stature would undertake a project they considered pedestrian. Yet, Gauss
saw in this undertaking, the chance to further his youthful efforts to
construct a physical geometry based on measurement. This work was
brought to fruition in his published papers on curvature, mapping and
geodesy, the which provided the foundation for Riemann's development of
complex functions.

The past two segments of this series have dealt with some of the ideas
developed by Gauss in his "General Investigations of Curved Surfaces"
,which established the principles of what, today, is called,
"differential geometry". Before turning to the more universal
applications of Gauss' geodetic investigations, it is advisable to
review a principle of Leibniz' calculus through the example of the
catenary.

The determination of the catenary, as the shape formed by a hanging
chain, required the discovery of a physical principle that, like the
square root of minus 1, was outside the rules, definitions and
procedures of Euclidean geometry, and outside the domain of
sense-perception. Leibniz and Bernoulli determined that, while that
physical principle could not be known by some a priori rule, it could be
discovered from the way it expressed itself in the smallest parts of the
chain.

To illustrate this, the reader should perform the pedagogical experiment
described by Bernoulli in his text on the integral calculus. Take a
string and tie a light weight to the middle of it. Take one end of the
string in each hand and let the weight hang freely between them. As you
pull your hands apart, you will feel an increase of force exerted on
your hands by the weight. If you lift one hand higher than the other,
the force on the raised hand increases, while the force on the lower
hand decreases.

To simulate the action that produces the catenary, now hold the string
in each hand very close to the weight. Move one hand so that it pulls
the weight away from the other, while allowing the string to slide
through both hands. As you do this, keep the segment of the string that
connects the weight with the stationary hand horizontal. (This simulates
the lowest point on the catenary.) To do this, you will have to
constantly raise the moving hand. The farther your hands are separated,
the faster the moving hand must be raised in order for the opposite
segment to remain horizontal. The curve traced out by the moving hand
will be the catenary.

The reason for performing the above described experiment, is to realize
that the catenary curve is physically determined. In order to keep one
of the string segments horizontal, the moving hand is compelled, by a
physical principle, to follow the catenary curve. The curve is not seen,
but its effects are "felt" by the moving hand, at every small interval
of action. That infinitesimal expression of the catenary principle,
Leibniz called the "differential".

These effects can be measured by the increasing length of the curve for
equal amounts of horizontal motion. In other words, when the hands first
start to move apart, the moving hand only has to be raised a little to
counteract the force of the weight. But as the moving hand moves further
out, the amount of vertical "lift" for small horizontal increments,
increases, which in turn, increases the length of the curve for
corresponding horizontal motion. [(See Figure
1.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part46_files_part46figure01.gif)

(Warning to those indoctrinated in Cartesian geometry: The horizontal
and vertical here are not Cartesian axes, but directions of motion,
physically determined with respect to the direction of the pull of
gravity.)

In the hanging chain this action happens all at once. The horizontal and
vertical are not simply directions of motion, they are the physically
determined boundaries at which the catenary ceases to exist. The curve
of the catenary unfolds as the path of least action between these two
extremes. Its length per unit of action increases as it nears the
vertical extreme, and decreases towards the horizontal. Since the length
of the curve is a direct function of the physical principle governing
the chain's action, it is an appropriate measure of that principle.

Gauss' geodetical investigations led him to extend Leibniz' calculus
into a higher domain.

All measurements of the Heavens and the Earth are made with respect to a
physically determined direction, as indicated by the direction of a free
hanging weight on a string, called a plumb bob. The surface of the Earth
is that surface that is everywhere perpendicular to the direction of the
plumb bob. The question Gauss investigated in his geodesy, is, " What is
the nature of this surface?" Since it were impossible to know the answer
from sense perception, Gauss determined the overall nature of the
surface of the Earth from small (differential) changes in action
measured on it.

To begin to grasp Gauss' idea, begin with the simpler case of the
celestial sphere. This sphere can be entirely determined by two angles,
one around the circle of the horizon, and one from the horizon to the
pole. These two angles define an orthogonal network of circles, which,
for pedagogical purposes, we will call latitude and longitude. The
longitudinal circles are great circles, which are what Gauss called
"geodesics" or shortest lines, while the latitudinal circles are not.

While these circles are always orthogonal to each other, nevertheless,
their relationships change, depending on where they are on the sphere.
As the longitudinal lines get closer to the poles, they get closer
together. Thus, the length of an arc of a circle of latitude between two
determined arcs of longitude changes, depending on its position with
respect to the poles. For example, the distance along the arcs of
latitude between two arcs of longitude separated by 10 degrees, will
decrease, as the latitudes get closer to the poles.

Now, compare that with a spheroid. Here, the lines of longitude are
elliptical, and the lines of latitude are circular. In this case, the
length of the arcs of latitude between two determined arcs of longitude
still get smaller as they approach the poles, but also, the length of
the arcs of longitude between any two determined arcs of latitude get
{longer} as they approach the poles. [(See Figure
3.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part46_files_part46figure03.gif)

This characteristic can be measured in a geodetic survey, by measuring
the lines of latitude as angular changes in the inclination of the north
star. If the Earth were a sphere, equal angular changes will correspond
to equal changes in length of the geodesic longitudinal lines. If these
geodesic lines get longer, with equal angular inclinations of the north
star, then the Earth is spheroidal. What the specific measurements of
that spheroid are, cannot be known by a priori mathematical methods, but
require more refined physical measurements, as developed by Gauss.

Now, look at an ellipsoid. Here the lengths of the lines of latitude
between any two determined lines of longitude, change, both as they
approach the poles, and as they move around in the "equatorial"
direction as well. Additionally, the lengths of the lines of longitude
between any determined lines of latitude, increase as they approach the
poles. [(See Figure
4.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part46_files_part46figure04.gif)

(Note: The accompanying computer generated graphics are supplied merely
to illustrate the text. The reader is strongly encouraged to make
physical demonstrations on real surfaces approximating these shapes. The
reader is also encouraged to experiment with wildly irregular shapes as
well.)

Gauss recognized this characteristic of change as a new type of
"differential", which, for pedagogical purposes, I will call "surface
differentials". Like Leibniz' differentials, these surface differentials
express how the overall principle of action of the surface is manifest
in every small part. However, instead of directly characterizing the
least-action pathways, i.e. geodesics, these "surface differentials"
characterize the changing nature of the principles through which the
least- action pathways unfold. In other words, the surface differential
expresses the characteristic of change of the principles that determine
the characteristics of change of all possible least-action pathways,
i.e. geodesics, on that surface.

To get an intuitive sense of this idea, think of these surface
differentials being approximated by small "rectangular" patches of the
surface. (See [Figure
5](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part46_files_part46figure05.gif)
, [Figure
6](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part46_files_part46figure06.gif)
, and [Figure
7](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part46_files/part46figure07) ). Notice
how the shape of these patches changes, as their positions change on the
different surfaces.

Gauss determined that the relationship between these surface
differentials and the characteristic geodesic lines of the surface could
be measured, because even though these geodesic lines are always the
shortest distance between two points on the surface, the length of the
geodesic with respect to the surface differential changes, according to
the overall curvature of the surface.

Gauss established the relationship between the surface differential and
the characteristic curvature of the changing geodesic line, as a
generalization of the Pythagorean relationship between the diagonal and
the side of the square or rectangle. In the case of a flat plane, (or
surface of zero-curvature, as Gauss would see it), the relationship of
the diagonal to the side of a square (or rectangle), expresses the power
that generates areas, as distinct from the power that generates lines.
Thus, the line that forms the diagonal of the square is a different type
of line than that line which forms the side of the square, because it is
generated by a higher power. This relationship can be measured by the
relationship of the length of the diagonal, to the lengths of the sides
of the square or rectangle. The common expression for this "Pythagorean"
relationship is that the length of the diagonal is equal to the square
root of the sum of the squares of the sides of the square or rectangle.

This "Pythagorean" relationship, Gauss showed, was just a special case
of a more general principle. On a curved surface, the sides of the
square are the constantly changing "sides" of the surface differential,
and the diagonal is the geodesic. The principle that governs the
constantly changing lengths of the "sides" of the surface differential
is a function of the curvature of the surface, which, in turn, is
reflected in the changing length of the geodesic diagonal. Consequently,
the overall curvature of the surface is reflected in the smallest parts
of the geodesic. From this Gauss devised a more general idea of the
"Pythagorean", in which the lengths of the "sides" of the surface
differential are multiplied by a function that characterizes the
physical curvature of the surface. As the surface differential changes
according to the curvature of the surface, the length of the geodesic
diagonal changes accordingly. (A future pedagogical will illustrate,
geometrically, Gauss' idea.)

To get an intuitive sense of this concept, look again at figures 5, 6,
and 7. Imagine the diagonals of each surface differential. Imagine how
the lengths of these diagonals change with the position of the surface
differential. Now conduct a similar investigation on the physical
surfaces you experimented with earlier. Draw on these surfaces geodesic
diagonals to the orthogonal curves you previously drew. This can be done
by holding a string taught between opposite corners of each
"rectangular" patch, and tracing the string path with a marker. Notice
the changes in length and direction of these diagonal's geodesic as the
curvature of the surface changes.

Now, look at a concrete example with respect to the physics of
navigation. On a flat surface draw a grid of orthogonal lines. Draw a
diagonal line that cuts all the vertical lines at the same angle. This
will produce a straight line. [(See Figure
8.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part46_files_part46figure08.gif)
Now try the same thing on a sphere. That is draw a series of geodesic
lines that cut the lines of longitude at a constant angle. The result is
not a straight line, but a spiral like curve called a "loxodrome" [(See
Figure
9.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part46_files_part46figure09.gif)
A navigator who has not mastered the principles of curvature, will find
himself getting farther and farther from his destination, and closer and
closer to the north pole!

From this relationship, Gauss showed that it were possible to discover
the surface differential, and thus the characteristic curvature of the
surface, by measuring small variations in the length of geodesic lines.
For example, in determining the length of the geodesic line that
connected his observatory in Goettingen with Schumacher's in Altona,
Gauss measured a 16 seconds of an arc deviation from what that length
should be if the Earth were a spheroid. That led Gauss to prove that the
shape of the Earth could not conform to any a priori geometric shape,
but was being determined by the physical characteristics of the Earth's
matter and its motion.
