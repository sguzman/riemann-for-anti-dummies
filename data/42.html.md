**Riemann for Anti-Dummies Part 42**

ARCHYTAS FROM THE STANDPOINT OF CUSA, GAUSS, AND RIEMANN

A citizen in 2003 A.D., wishing to muster the conceptual power necessary
to comprehend today's historical, political and economic crisis, and to
act to change it, will find it of great benefit to bind into one
thought, Archytas' construction for finding two mean proportionals
between two extremes, (circa 400 B.C.), with Bernhard Riemann's 1854
lecture, "On the Hypothesis which Underlie the Foundations of Geometry".
Two thoughts, separated temporally by 2400 years, recreated
simultaneously by one mind yours.

The summary of the relevant concept, spoken by the then 28 year old
Riemann acting under the tutelage of the 77 year old C.F. Gauss, focuses
on the relationship of the idea to that which creates it:

"Accordingly, I have proposed to myself at first the problem of
constructing the concept of a multiply extended magnitude out of general
notions of quantity. From this it will result that a multiply extended
magnitude is susceptible of various metric relations and that space
accordingly constitutes only a particular case of a triply-extended
magnitude. A necessary sequel of this is that the propositions of
geometry are not derivable from general concepts of quantity, but that
those properties by which space is distinguished from other conceivable
triply extended magnitudes can be gathered only from experience. There
arises from this the problem of searching out the simplest facts by
which the metric relations of space can be determined, a problem which
in nature of things is not quite definite; for several systems of simple
facts can be stated which would suffice for determining the metric
relations of space; the most important for present purposes is that laid
down for foundations by Euclid. These facts are, like all facts, not
necessary but of a merely empirical certainty; they are hypotheses; one
may therefore inquire into their probability, which is truly very great
within the bounds of observation, and thereafter decide concerning the
admissibility of protracting them outside the limits of observation, not
only toward the immeasurably large, but also toward the immeasurably
small."

It must be kept in mind, that Archytas, like Riemann and Gauss, was
anti-Euclidean. In fact, even Euclid was more anti-Euclidean than
today's neo-Aristotelean followers of Galileo, Newton and Kant, who
assert that physical space-time conforms, a-priori, to the axioms,
postulates and definitions of Euclidean geometry. No where in Euclid's
Elements is such a preposterous assertion stated. Rather, the Elements
are a compilation of earlier discoveries that could never have been
produced by the logical deductive methods used in the Elements. The
actual method of discovery is best indicated when the Elements are read
backwards; from the 13th book on the spherical derivation of the five
regular solids, to the 10th book on incommensurables, to the middle
books on proportions, to the opening sections on the circular derivation
of constructions in a plane.

Archytas' magnificent composition could only have been produced by a
mind closer to Riemann's than Euclid's, and, having lived and worked
nearly a century earlier, we can be assured that his was not constricted
by the deductive method of the Elements, let alone its later
Aristotelean transmogrifications. The few extant fragments of Archytas
indicate his concept of mathematics was far different from today's
formalists:

"Mathematicians seem to me to have excellent discernment, and it is not
at all strange that they should think correctly about the particulars
that are; for inasmuch as they can discern excellently about the physics
of the universe, they are also likely to have excellent perspective on
the particulars that are. Indeed, they have transmitted to us a keen
discernment about the velocities of the stars and their risings and
settings, and about geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, and, not least of
all, music. These seem to be sister sciences, for they concern
themselves with the first two related forms of being number and
magnitude."

As with his collaborator Plato, Archytas understood that the betterment
of humanity depended on the improvement of the cognitive powers of the
mind through pedagogical exercises:

"When mathematical reasoning has been found, it checks political faction
and increases concord, for there is no unfair advantage in its presence,
and equality reigns. With mathematical reasoning we smooth out
differences in our dealings with each other. Through it the poor take
from the powerful, and the rich give to the needy, both trusting in it
to obtain an equal share."

However, today's responsible citizen need not rely merely on fragmentary
quotes to bring Archytas' method into his or her mind. A more secure
approach is directly accessible--coming to know for oneself, Archytas'
solution for the problem of doubling the cube a method advocated by
Archytas himself:

"To become knowledgeable about things one does not know, one must either
learn from others or find out for oneself. Now learning derives from
someone else and is foreign, whereas finding out is of and by oneself.
Finding out without seeking is difficult and rare, but with seeking it
is manageable and easy, though someone who does not know how to seek
cannot find."

**The Polyphonic Determination of Mean Proportionals**

To begin to obtain knowledge of Archytas' method, one must throw out all
axiomatic/deductive approaches and adopt the physical/geometrical
approach demonstrated by Jonathan Tennenbaum in his quite notable
pedagogical exercise: "A Note: Why Modern Mathematicians Can't
Understand Archytas" That discussion should be throughly worked through
and forms an excellent basis for the pedagogical workshops now taking
place among youth organizers and others. That argument is summarized
here with the aid of some graphics and animations.

To double the cube, Archytas focused on the more general form of the
problem posed by Hippocrates of Cios, that of placing two means between
two extremes. Hippocrates had recognized that when doubling the square,
the areas of the squares produced, as well as the corresponding sides,
were all in what the Pythagoreans called "geometric" proportion. A
similar relationship held when doubling cubes, but with one notable
exception. Instead of one geometric mean between each action, the cube
required two.

For example, if we take a square and double its side, the area of the
square so produced quadruples. Thus, the square whose area is double, is
the geometric mean between the original square and the square produced
by doubling its side. That proportion expressed in numbers is 1:2::2:4.
This same proportion is reflected among the sides of the three squares.
That is, the side of the square of 1 is to the side of the square of
two, as the side of the square of two is to the side of the square of
four. Or, in numbers, 1:\\/2::\\/2:2. Thus, doubling a square amounts to
constructing the geometric mean between 1 and 2.

However, when the edge of a cube is doubled, the volume of the cube
increases from 1 to 8. From the standpoint of whole numbers, there are
two geometric means between 1 and 8, specifically 2 and 4. Hippocrates
noted that a similar proportionality exists between the edges of these
cubes. The problem, as Riemann would recognize it, is extending this
relationship outside the realm of visible observation between 1 and 8,
into the smaller interval between 1 and 2. The discrepancy between what
can be done in the large and with what can be done in the small, is
analogous to the idea of a changing geodesic from the macro-physical to
the micro-physical domain, and indicates that the doubling of cube is an
action of a higher power, as Plato defines power.

The relationship between the problem of doubling the cube and the
problem of finding two geometric means between two extremes, can prove a
stubborn one to master for those stuck in logical/deductive habits. The
root of this mental block is in large part due to the false, but
persistent, habit of trying to understand things from the bottom up.
While in the domain of squares, the geometric means from one to eight
are created one at a time, one, then two, then four, then eight; in the
domain of cubes, these two geometric means, must be created all at once
from the top down.

Archytas, who understood music, geometry, number and sphaerics
(astronomy) as one, would have no more problem with this than J.S. Bach,
Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann or Brahms. For the well-tempered
system of bel-canto polyphony is not produced from the bottom up, note
by note. Rather, each note is determined from the relationships that
arise from bel-canto sung polyphony. Thus, think of the placing of two
means between two extremes in the same epistemological light as a
musical composition. The composer's idea of the composition determines
the relationship among the notes. The question Archytas solved, was,
"What composition produces two geometric means between two extremes?"

As demonstrated in the above cited pedagogical discussion by Jonathan
Tennenbaum, the placing of one geometric mean is a function of circular
rotation, not the generation of squares. While the doubling of the
square requires finding the geometric mean between 1 and 2, the circle
expresses the placement of a geometric mean between any two extremes.
[(See figure

In the figure, triangle OPA is inscribed in a semi-circle making the
angle at P a right angle.(fn.1.) A line drawn from P perpendicular to
diameter at Q, forms a whole set of geometric proportions. The one that
most concerns us here is OQ:OP::OP::OA. As P rotates around the circle
from A to O, OP remains the geometric mean between OQ and OA, even
though the proportion between OQ and OA changes from 1:1 to 1:0.(fn2.)

As indicated in Jonathan's pedagogical, a second set of geometric
proportions can be linked to this first set, by drawing a circle around
right angle OPQ and finding B as a projection of Q onto OP. [(See figure
2.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part42_files_part42figure02.gif)
This produces the double set of geometric proportions
OB:OQ::OQ:OP::OP::OA. Now, as P moves from A to O, not only do the
geometric relationships between OQ, OP and OA change, but so do the
geometric relationships between OQ, OB and OP. [(See animation

Think of these sets of relationships polyphonically. OQ:OP::OP:OA is one
voice. OB:OQ::OQ::OP is a second voice. The internal relationships
within each voice are the same, but together they form a relationship
between two sets of relationships, akin to the voices in a two part
fugue.

The problem Archytas confronted is expressed by the non-uniform nature
of the curve traced by B as P moves around the larger circle. In order
to double the cube, there must be some definite way to determine a ratio
between OB and OA of 1:2.

Archytas recognized that this could not be determined in what Riemann
called a doubly-extended manifold, but rather, was derived from the
higher powers associated with a triply-extended manifold.

Archytas effected this by generating the first set of geometric means
from rotating one circle (with diameter AO) perpendicular to another
(with diameter OD). [(See animation
3.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part42_files_part42animation03.gif)
A point P on circle AO connected perpendicularly to a point Q on the
circumference of circle OD, produces the geometric relationship,
OQ:OP::OP::OA. The action of the rotating circle AO produces a torus.

The intersection of the torus and cylinder forms a curve of double
curvature, which expresses, from the standpoint of a higher power, the
geometric relationships between OQ, OP and OA. Now, when Q is projected
to a point B on OP the relationship OB:OQ::OQ:OP::OP:OA is produced.

From this, the magnitude that doubles the cube can be found by
constructing OM as a chord of circle OQD so that it is of diameter OD.
[(See Figure
4.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part42_files_part42figure04.gif)
Rotate chord OM around the axis OD until it coincides with line OP. This
action produces a cone with apex at O and axis OD. P now lies at the
intersection of a cone, torus and cylinder. After this rotation, M will
coincide with B and the length of OB will equal OM. Consequently, if
OB=1, OQ is the edge of the cube whose volume is 2; OP is the edge of
the cube whose volume is 4; and OA is the edge of the cube whose volume
is 8.

**The Maximum and Minimum**

With the just completed work fresh in mind, step back and ask an
elementary question. What universal principle is expressed by the
physical characteristic that a doubly extended manifold expresses one
geometric mean between two extremes, while a triply extended one
requires two? As Plato states in the Timaeus, this is not an abstract
question, but one necessary to know in order to understand the real
world:

"Now if the body of the One had to come into existence as a plane
surface, having no depth, one mean would have sufficed to bind together
both itself and its fellow terms; but now it is otherwise; for it
behoved it to be solid of shape and what brings solids into unison is
never one mean but always two."

A crucial insight can be gained when this question is examined from the
standpoint of Nicholas of Cusa's principle of the Maximum and Minimum.

Look back at our initial exploration of geometric means. We discovered
that this relationship is expressed by a right angle in a circle. But,
there was an underlying assumption that we didn't investigate. What is a
right angle? Should we accept some definition, such as Euclid's, that a
right angle is that angle formed when two lines that intersect form two
angles that are equal? Should we accept the definition of right angle as
that angle inscribed in a semi-circle, when such a definition assumes
that the sum of the angles of a triangle equals two right angles? As
Kaestner and Gauss would later demonstrate, such definitions already
assume that the manifold in which the action occurs is characterized by
infinite flatness.

Even before Kaestner and Gauss raised these questions, Cusa recognized
that such formal definitions never lead to the truth. For Cusa, the
truth is the unqualifiedly Maximum, which, in the Absolute, coincides
with the unqualifiedly Minimum.

"Therefore, the truth, which is itself the measure of things, is not
comprehensible except through itself. And one sees that in the
coincidence of the measure and the measured. Indeed, in everything this
side of the infinite, the measure and the measured differ according to
more or less. In God, however, they coincide. The coincidence of
opposites is therefore like the periphery of the infinite circle. The
distance of opposites is as the periphery of the finite polygon.
Therefore, in theological figures the complement of that which can be
known is to know this, namely, that in the infinite the difference of
the measure and the measured is in God equality or coincidence. Hence,
the measuring is there infinite rectitude. And the infinite circular
line is measurable through infinite rectitude. And the measuring itself
is the unity or the connection of both."

This method of the maximum and minimum is already implicit in the
problem addressed by Archytas. The maximum and minimum coincide in God,
but "this side of the infinite" they're opposites. Physical action, can
be thought of as least-action, or a mean between the extremes of the
minimum and maximum.

As Cusa notes, the circle is generated as the action that encompasses
the maximum area by the minimum circumference, otherwise known as
"isoperimetric". This action of circular rotation, itself contains a
maximum and minimum. If the rotation begins from a point A, then there
is some point O at which the rotating point has reached a maximum
divergence from A and begins to converge back towards A. Thus, the
circle, which is itself a maximum/minimum, contains within it, another
maximum/minimum, expressed by the ends of the diameter as points of
maximum divergence.

This principle of maximum divergence within a circle, also contains
within it, a maximum and minimum. The angle formed by a line pivoting
about the center of the circle reaches an angle of maximum divergence,
which now defines a right angle, which Cusa calls the maximum acute
angle and the minimum obtuse angle. In other words, instead of defining
a right angle as a thing, think of it as a maximum/minimum within a
circle, which is itself a maximum/minimum within a doubly-extended
manifold. It is here, in the nature of the doubly- extended manifold,
that the minimum/maximum characteristics expressed by the circle, and in
turn, the right angle, are determined.

Thought of from this standpoint, the geometric mean expresses this
maximum/minimum relationship of what Riemann would call a
doubly-extended manifold. In sum, the circle expresses the
maximum/minimum characteristic of a doubly-extended manifold; the right
angle, in turn, expresses the maximum/minimum characteristic of a
circle. From Cusa's standpoint, the geometric mean can be thought of as
the mean between the maximum and minimum right angle, (as illustrated in
the in the first animation.)

Thought of in this way, the geometric mean is not produced by squares.
Rather, the squares are artifacts, generated by the placing of one
geometric mean between two extremes, which is the characteristic least
action principle of a doubly-extended manifold of zero-curvature.

Now on to the real world of solids as exemplified by cubes. Cubes
express two geometric means between two extremes. From the standpoint of
Cusa's maximum/minimum, this relationship must express a mean between
the minimum and maximum in what Riemann would call a triply-extended
manifold. The expression of the maximum/minimum in a triply- extended
manifold is spherical action, which encloses the maximum volume in the
minimum surface, and produces two orthogonal degrees of circular action.
Each circle expresses a complete set of geometric means. But, the two
means that produce solid bodies, such as cubes, are only generated when
the spherical action is "unfolded" as in Archytas' construction.

As in the case of the square, the cube does not produce two means
between two extremes. Cubes are artifacts generated when two geometric
means are placed between two extremes of spherical action, when that
action is "unfolded" as in Archytas' composition. This is a
characteristic least-action principle of a triply-extended manifold.

**Kepler's Orbits and the Catenary**

Cusa's method of maximum/minimum led to a revolution in scientific
thinking as typified by Kepler's determination of the harmonic ordering
of planetary motion. The position of any planet within its orbit, Kepler
demonstrated, is determined by the minimum and maximum speeds of that
orbit. From aphelion the planet increases its speed non-uniformly as
determined by the speed it intends to be at when it reaches perihelion,
and inversely, from perihelion back to aphelion. Thus, each planet's
orbit is a type of mean between these two extremes. Kepler further
showed that these intra-orbital extremes when thought of together, form
a set of means, as expressed by the musical harmonic relationships among
them.

Similarly for Leibniz' principle of the catenary. As both he and
Bernoulli showed, the catenary unfolds its "orbital" pathway from its
lowest point, which is the only point that holds up no chain. From a
physical standpoint, the catenary is a mean, a least-action pathway,
between the maximum potential force and minimum potential force, which
are exerted at right angles to each other. This example will rankle
anyone stuck in a Cartesian coordinate system, where the horizontal and
vertical axes are straight-lines, and the mean between them is just
another straight-line at a 45 degree angle to both. In Leibniz' physical
geometry, the vertical and horizontal are the potential maximum and
minimum of physical action, and the catenary is the least action pathway
between these two extremes.

Freed, now, from the "ivory tower" notions of Euclidean geometry, as
Archytas was, we can gain a greater comprehension of the expression of
Cusa's principle of the maximum/minimum in the Gauss/Riemann complex
domain. This is where we'll begin in the next installment.

FOOTNOTES

1\. This should not be taken for granted, and so the reader is
encouraged to discover a demonstration that an angle inscribed in a
semi-circle is a right angle. The original proof of this is attributed
to Thales. The proof in Euclid, III. 31, is based on Euclid's earlier
proof that the sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to two right
angles, which Kaestner, Gauss and Riemann would later note depends on
the parallel postulate, which in turn depends on an assumption about the
nature of the curvature of space. As, Riemann noted in his 1854
habilitation lecture, "these facts are, like all facts, not necessary
but of a merely empirical certainty; they are hypotheses;"

2\. Here we confront another paradox of abstract mathematics between the
expression of the geometric mean in numerical terms, and its physical
geometric expression.

**Riemann for Anti-Dummies Part 42**

ARCHYTAS FROM THE STANDPOINT OF CUSA, GAUSS, AND RIEMANN

A citizen in 2003 A.D., wishing to muster the conceptual power necessary
to comprehend today's historical, political and economic crisis, and to
act to change it, will find it of great benefit to bind into one
thought, Archytas' construction for finding two mean proportionals
between two extremes, (circa 400 B.C.), with Bernhard Riemann's 1854
lecture, "On the Hypothesis which Underlie the Foundations of Geometry".
Two thoughts, separated temporally by 2400 years, recreated
simultaneously by one mind yours.

The summary of the relevant concept, spoken by the then 28 year old
Riemann acting under the tutelage of the 77 year old C.F. Gauss, focuses
on the relationship of the idea to that which creates it:

"Accordingly, I have proposed to myself at first the problem of
constructing the concept of a multiply extended magnitude out of general
notions of quantity. From this it will result that a multiply extended
magnitude is susceptible of various metric relations and that space
accordingly constitutes only a particular case of a triply-extended
magnitude. A necessary sequel of this is that the propositions of
geometry are not derivable from general concepts of quantity, but that
those properties by which space is distinguished from other conceivable
triply extended magnitudes can be gathered only from experience. There
arises from this the problem of searching out the simplest facts by
which the metric relations of space can be determined, a problem which
in nature of things is not quite definite; for several systems of simple
facts can be stated which would suffice for determining the metric
relations of space; the most important for present purposes is that laid
down for foundations by Euclid. These facts are, like all facts, not
necessary but of a merely empirical certainty; they are hypotheses; one
may therefore inquire into their probability, which is truly very great
within the bounds of observation, and thereafter decide concerning the
admissibility of protracting them outside the limits of observation, not
only toward the immeasurably large, but also toward the immeasurably
small."

It must be kept in mind, that Archytas, like Riemann and Gauss, was
anti-Euclidean. In fact, even Euclid was more anti-Euclidean than
today's neo-Aristotelean followers of Galileo, Newton and Kant, who
assert that physical space-time conforms, a-priori, to the axioms,
postulates and definitions of Euclidean geometry. No where in Euclid's
Elements is such a preposterous assertion stated. Rather, the Elements
are a compilation of earlier discoveries that could never have been
produced by the logical deductive methods used in the Elements. The
actual method of discovery is best indicated when the Elements are read
backwards; from the 13th book on the spherical derivation of the five
regular solids, to the 10th book on incommensurables, to the middle
books on proportions, to the opening sections on the circular derivation
of constructions in a plane.

Archytas' magnificent composition could only have been produced by a
mind closer to Riemann's than Euclid's, and, having lived and worked
nearly a century earlier, we can be assured that his was not constricted
by the deductive method of the Elements, let alone its later
Aristotelean transmogrifications. The few extant fragments of Archytas
indicate his concept of mathematics was far different from today's
formalists:

"Mathematicians seem to me to have excellent discernment, and it is not
at all strange that they should think correctly about the particulars
that are; for inasmuch as they can discern excellently about the physics
of the universe, they are also likely to have excellent perspective on
the particulars that are. Indeed, they have transmitted to us a keen
discernment about the velocities of the stars and their risings and
settings, and about geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, and, not least of
all, music. These seem to be sister sciences, for they concern
themselves with the first two related forms of being number and
magnitude."

As with his collaborator Plato, Archytas understood that the betterment
of humanity depended on the improvement of the cognitive powers of the
mind through pedagogical exercises:

"When mathematical reasoning has been found, it checks political faction
and increases concord, for there is no unfair advantage in its presence,
and equality reigns. With mathematical reasoning we smooth out
differences in our dealings with each other. Through it the poor take
from the powerful, and the rich give to the needy, both trusting in it
to obtain an equal share."

However, today's responsible citizen need not rely merely on fragmentary
quotes to bring Archytas' method into his or her mind. A more secure
approach is directly accessible--coming to know for oneself, Archytas'
solution for the problem of doubling the cube a method advocated by
Archytas himself:

"To become knowledgeable about things one does not know, one must either
learn from others or find out for oneself. Now learning derives from
someone else and is foreign, whereas finding out is of and by oneself.
Finding out without seeking is difficult and rare, but with seeking it
is manageable and easy, though someone who does not know how to seek
cannot find."

**The Polyphonic Determination of Mean Proportionals**

To begin to obtain knowledge of Archytas' method, one must throw out all
axiomatic/deductive approaches and adopt the physical/geometrical
approach demonstrated by Jonathan Tennenbaum in his quite notable
pedagogical exercise: "A Note: Why Modern Mathematicians Can't
Understand Archytas" That discussion should be throughly worked through
and forms an excellent basis for the pedagogical workshops now taking
place among youth organizers and others. That argument is summarized
here with the aid of some graphics and animations.

To double the cube, Archytas focused on the more general form of the
problem posed by Hippocrates of Cios, that of placing two means between
two extremes. Hippocrates had recognized that when doubling the square,
the areas of the squares produced, as well as the corresponding sides,
were all in what the Pythagoreans called "geometric" proportion. A
similar relationship held when doubling cubes, but with one notable
exception. Instead of one geometric mean between each action, the cube
required two.

For example, if we take a square and double its side, the area of the
square so produced quadruples. Thus, the square whose area is double, is
the geometric mean between the original square and the square produced
by doubling its side. That proportion expressed in numbers is 1:2::2:4.
This same proportion is reflected among the sides of the three squares.
That is, the side of the square of 1 is to the side of the square of
two, as the side of the square of two is to the side of the square of
four. Or, in numbers, 1:\\/2::\\/2:2. Thus, doubling a square amounts to
constructing the geometric mean between 1 and 2.

However, when the edge of a cube is doubled, the volume of the cube
increases from 1 to 8. From the standpoint of whole numbers, there are
two geometric means between 1 and 8, specifically 2 and 4. Hippocrates
noted that a similar proportionality exists between the edges of these
cubes. The problem, as Riemann would recognize it, is extending this
relationship outside the realm of visible observation between 1 and 8,
into the smaller interval between 1 and 2. The discrepancy between what
can be done in the large and with what can be done in the small, is
analogous to the idea of a changing geodesic from the macro-physical to
the micro-physical domain, and indicates that the doubling of cube is an
action of a higher power, as Plato defines power.

The relationship between the problem of doubling the cube and the
problem of finding two geometric means between two extremes, can prove a
stubborn one to master for those stuck in logical/deductive habits. The
root of this mental block is in large part due to the false, but
persistent, habit of trying to understand things from the bottom up.
While in the domain of squares, the geometric means from one to eight
are created one at a time, one, then two, then four, then eight; in the
domain of cubes, these two geometric means, must be created all at once
from the top down.

Archytas, who understood music, geometry, number and sphaerics
(astronomy) as one, would have no more problem with this than J.S. Bach,
Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann or Brahms. For the well-tempered
system of bel-canto polyphony is not produced from the bottom up, note
by note. Rather, each note is determined from the relationships that
arise from bel-canto sung polyphony. Thus, think of the placing of two
means between two extremes in the same epistemological light as a
musical composition. The composer's idea of the composition determines
the relationship among the notes. The question Archytas solved, was,
"What composition produces two geometric means between two extremes?"

As demonstrated in the above cited pedagogical discussion by Jonathan
Tennenbaum, the placing of one geometric mean is a function of circular
rotation, not the generation of squares. While the doubling of the
square requires finding the geometric mean between 1 and 2, the circle
expresses the placement of a geometric mean between any two extremes.
[(See figure
1.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part42_files_part42figure01.gif)
In the figure, triangle OPA is inscribed in a semi-circle making the
angle at P a right angle.(fn.1.) A line drawn from P perpendicular to
diameter at Q, forms a whole set of geometric proportions. The one that
most concerns us here is OQ:OP::OP::OA. As P rotates around the circle
from A to O, OP remains the geometric mean between OQ and OA, even
though the proportion between OQ and OA changes from 1:1 to 1:0.(fn2.)

As indicated in Jonathan's pedagogical, a second set of geometric
proportions can be linked to this first set, by drawing a circle around
right angle OPQ and finding B as a projection of Q onto OP. [(See figure
2.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part42_files_part42figure02.gif)
This produces the double set of geometric proportions
OB:OQ::OQ:OP::OP::OA. Now, as P moves from A to O, not only do the
geometric relationships between OQ, OP and OA change, but so do the
geometric relationships between OQ, OB and OP. [(See animation

Think of these sets of relationships polyphonically. OQ:OP::OP:OA is one
voice. OB:OQ::OQ::OP is a second voice. The internal relationships
within each voice are the same, but together they form a relationship
between two sets of relationships, akin to the voices in a two part
fugue.

The problem Archytas confronted is expressed by the non-uniform nature
of the curve traced by B as P moves around the larger circle. In order
to double the cube, there must be some definite way to determine a ratio
between OB and OA of 1:2.

Archytas recognized that this could not be determined in what Riemann
called a doubly-extended manifold, but rather, was derived from the
higher powers associated with a triply-extended manifold.

Archytas effected this by generating the first set of geometric means
from rotating one circle (with diameter AO) perpendicular to another
(with diameter OD). [(See animation
3.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part42_files_part42animation03.gif)
A point P on circle AO connected perpendicularly to a point Q on the
circumference of circle OD, produces the geometric relationship,
OQ:OP::OP::OA. The action of the rotating circle AO produces a torus.

The rotation of PQ produces a cylinder [(See animation
5.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part42_files_part42animation05.gif)
The intersection of the torus and cylinder forms a curve of double
curvature, which expresses, from the standpoint of a higher power, the
geometric relationships between OQ, OP and OA. Now, when Q is projected
to a point B on OP the relationship OB:OQ::OQ:OP::OP:OA is produced.

From this, the magnitude that doubles the cube can be found by
constructing OM as a chord of circle OQD so that it is of diameter OD.
[(See Figure
4.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part42_files_part42figure04.gif)
Rotate chord OM around the axis OD until it coincides with line OP. This
action produces a cone with apex at O and axis OD. P now lies at the
intersection of a cone, torus and cylinder. After this rotation, M will
coincide with B and the length of OB will equal OM. Consequently, if
OB=1, OQ is the edge of the cube whose volume is 2; OP is the edge of
the cube whose volume is 4; and OA is the edge of the cube whose volume
is 8.

**The Maximum and Minimum**

With the just completed work fresh in mind, step back and ask an
elementary question. What universal principle is expressed by the
physical characteristic that a doubly extended manifold expresses one
geometric mean between two extremes, while a triply extended one
requires two? As Plato states in the Timaeus, this is not an abstract
question, but one necessary to know in order to understand the real
world:

"Now if the body of the One had to come into existence as a plane
surface, having no depth, one mean would have sufficed to bind together
both itself and its fellow terms; but now it is otherwise; for it
behoved it to be solid of shape and what brings solids into unison is
never one mean but always two."

A crucial insight can be gained when this question is examined from the
standpoint of Nicholas of Cusa's principle of the Maximum and Minimum.

Look back at our initial exploration of geometric means. We discovered
that this relationship is expressed by a right angle in a circle. But,
there was an underlying assumption that we didn't investigate. What is a
right angle? Should we accept some definition, such as Euclid's, that a
right angle is that angle formed when two lines that intersect form two
angles that are equal? Should we accept the definition of right angle as
that angle inscribed in a semi-circle, when such a definition assumes
that the sum of the angles of a triangle equals two right angles? As
Kaestner and Gauss would later demonstrate, such definitions already
assume that the manifold in which the action occurs is characterized by
infinite flatness.

Even before Kaestner and Gauss raised these questions, Cusa recognized
that such formal definitions never lead to the truth. For Cusa, the
truth is the unqualifiedly Maximum, which, in the Absolute, coincides
with the unqualifiedly Minimum.

"Therefore, the truth, which is itself the measure of things, is not
comprehensible except through itself. And one sees that in the
coincidence of the measure and the measured. Indeed, in everything this
side of the infinite, the measure and the measured differ according to
more or less. In God, however, they coincide. The coincidence of
opposites is therefore like the periphery of the infinite circle. The
distance of opposites is as the periphery of the finite polygon.
Therefore, in theological figures the complement of that which can be
known is to know this, namely, that in the infinite the difference of
the measure and the measured is in God equality or coincidence. Hence,
the measuring is there infinite rectitude. And the infinite circular
line is measurable through infinite rectitude. And the measuring itself
is the unity or the connection of both."

This method of the maximum and minimum is already implicit in the
problem addressed by Archytas. The maximum and minimum coincide in God,
but "this side of the infinite" they're opposites. Physical action, can
be thought of as least-action, or a mean between the extremes of the
minimum and maximum.

As Cusa notes, the circle is generated as the action that encompasses
the maximum area by the minimum circumference, otherwise known as
"isoperimetric". This action of circular rotation, itself contains a
maximum and minimum. If the rotation begins from a point A, then there
is some point O at which the rotating point has reached a maximum
divergence from A and begins to converge back towards A. Thus, the
circle, which is itself a maximum/minimum, contains within it, another
maximum/minimum, expressed by the ends of the diameter as points of
maximum divergence.

This principle of maximum divergence within a circle, also contains
within it, a maximum and minimum. The angle formed by a line pivoting
about the center of the circle reaches an angle of maximum divergence,
which now defines a right angle, which Cusa calls the maximum acute
angle and the minimum obtuse angle. In other words, instead of defining
a right angle as a thing, think of it as a maximum/minimum within a
circle, which is itself a maximum/minimum within a doubly-extended
manifold. It is here, in the nature of the doubly- extended manifold,
that the minimum/maximum characteristics expressed by the circle, and in
turn, the right angle, are determined.

Thought of from this standpoint, the geometric mean expresses this
maximum/minimum relationship of what Riemann would call a
doubly-extended manifold. In sum, the circle expresses the
maximum/minimum characteristic of a doubly-extended manifold; the right
angle, in turn, expresses the maximum/minimum characteristic of a
circle. From Cusa's standpoint, the geometric mean can be thought of as
the mean between the maximum and minimum right angle, (as illustrated in
the in the first animation.)

Thought of in this way, the geometric mean is not produced by squares.
Rather, the squares are artifacts, generated by the placing of one
geometric mean between two extremes, which is the characteristic least
action principle of a doubly-extended manifold of zero-curvature.

Now on to the real world of solids as exemplified by cubes. Cubes
express two geometric means between two extremes. From the standpoint of
Cusa's maximum/minimum, this relationship must express a mean between
the minimum and maximum in what Riemann would call a triply-extended
manifold. The expression of the maximum/minimum in a triply- extended
manifold is spherical action, which encloses the maximum volume in the
minimum surface, and produces two orthogonal degrees of circular action.
Each circle expresses a complete set of geometric means. But, the two
means that produce solid bodies, such as cubes, are only generated when
the spherical action is "unfolded" as in Archytas' construction.

As in the case of the square, the cube does not produce two means
between two extremes. Cubes are artifacts generated when two geometric
means are placed between two extremes of spherical action, when that
action is "unfolded" as in Archytas' composition. This is a
characteristic least-action principle of a triply-extended manifold.

**Kepler's Orbits and the Catenary**

Cusa's method of maximum/minimum led to a revolution in scientific
thinking as typified by Kepler's determination of the harmonic ordering
of planetary motion. The position of any planet within its orbit, Kepler
demonstrated, is determined by the minimum and maximum speeds of that
orbit. From aphelion the planet increases its speed non-uniformly as
determined by the speed it intends to be at when it reaches perihelion,
and inversely, from perihelion back to aphelion. Thus, each planet's
orbit is a type of mean between these two extremes. Kepler further
showed that these intra-orbital extremes when thought of together, form
a set of means, as expressed by the musical harmonic relationships among
them.

Similarly for Leibniz' principle of the catenary. As both he and
Bernoulli showed, the catenary unfolds its "orbital" pathway from its
lowest point, which is the only point that holds up no chain. From a
physical standpoint, the catenary is a mean, a least-action pathway,
between the maximum potential force and minimum potential force, which
are exerted at right angles to each other. This example will rankle
anyone stuck in a Cartesian coordinate system, where the horizontal and
vertical axes are straight-lines, and the mean between them is just
another straight-line at a 45 degree angle to both. In Leibniz' physical
geometry, the vertical and horizontal are the potential maximum and
minimum of physical action, and the catenary is the least action pathway
between these two extremes.

Freed, now, from the "ivory tower" notions of Euclidean geometry, as
Archytas was, we can gain a greater comprehension of the expression of
Cusa's principle of the maximum/minimum in the Gauss/Riemann complex
domain. This is where we'll begin in the next installment.

FOOTNOTES

1\. This should not be taken for granted, and so the reader is
encouraged to discover a demonstration that an angle inscribed in a
semi-circle is a right angle. The original proof of this is attributed
to Thales. The proof in Euclid, III. 31, is based on Euclid's earlier
proof that the sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to two right
angles, which Kaestner, Gauss and Riemann would later note depends on
the parallel postulate, which in turn depends on an assumption about the
nature of the curvature of space. As, Riemann noted in his 1854
habilitation lecture, "these facts are, like all facts, not necessary
but of a merely empirical certainty; they are hypotheses;"

2\. Here we confront another paradox of abstract mathematics between the
expression of the geometric mean in numerical terms, and its physical
geometric expression.
