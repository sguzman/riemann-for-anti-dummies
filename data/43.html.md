ISAAC NEWTON: GODMOTHER OF BABY-BOOMER BOOKKEEPING

Baby Boomers, wishing to cure themselves of the afflictions endemic to
their generation, will find the administration of a purgative that
clears their spirit of the prejudices expressed by Newton's first "law"
of motion, to be of great therapeutic benefit. This "law", which Newton
cribbed from Paolo Sarpi's Galileo, asserts that bodies in motion move
uniformly in straight lines, and bodies at rest stay at rest, unless
disturbed. The spread of the epistemological disease associated with
this edict has been greatly facilitated by the high priests of modern
science, who, acting in the manner and style of their Babylonian and
Roman predecessors, have promulgated it as a "law of nature". The
contagion has now permeated into such diverse areas of human activity as
the design and operation of space vehicles, the maintenance of basic
economic infrastructure, the tragic choice of political candidates, and
the truthful keeping of financial books.

The latter is, perhaps, one of the most effective clinical methods for
recognizing the extent of the underlying malady, for Newton's "first
law" is exemplary of the bookkeeping methods typical of Enron, WorldCom,
Winstar and other Baby Boomer parodies of Shelley's Ozymandias. Today's
"aggressive accounting" is, in fact, a subset of Newton's effort to
foist a false set of books on the entire universe, and account for all
real physical action as an aberration caused by the mysterious
intervention of "outside forces". Just as Baby Boomers do today, Newton
absolved himself of moral responsibility with the sophistic disclaimer,
"Hypothesis non fingo", which is otherwise more truthfully stated as,
"the Devil made me do it."

As Bernhard Riemann noted in an unpublished philosophical fragment:

"The distinction that Newton makes between laws of motion, or axioms,
and hypotheses, does not seem tenable to me. The law of inertia is the
hypothesis: If a material point were present alone in the world and
moved in space with a definite velocity, then it would constantly
maintain this velocity."

Newton's extrication of hypothesis from the universe, like the keeping
of a Baby Boomer's "feel good" set of financial books, is nothing but
self-delusion. As Kepler demonstrated, following in the intellectual
tradition of Plato and Cusa, the trajectories of all material bodies,
such as planets, are determined by a set of physical principles, which
are to the physical universe as hypotheses are to the human mind. But,
while non-living material bodies, act according to the principle of
mind, human beings possess one, giving them the capacity (power),
whether they wish to acknowledge it or not, to control and change their
trajectories by changing the principles that govern them. Given this,
the willful creation of hypotheses, like a truthful set of books, is the
only sane course for humans to chart.

**What is Straight Anyway?**

To chart this course we must recognize, as Riemann, his teacher Gauss
and his teacher Kaestner did, that Newton was pulling the classic
magician's trick with his first law of motion. By directing the
attention of the observer to a mythical material point, the credulous
audience focuses their attention on what appears to be the straight-line
path of the point. While fixated on what they imagine they see, the
audience fails to account for the unstated, but controlling, assumption
governing the action, to wit: the material point is moving in a plane as
defined in Euclid's Elements. In other words, the straight-line path of
the material point is a function of the assumption that the space in
which it moves is a flat plane. In this way, the books are rigged to
produce the pre-desired result.

Gauss caught on to this trick in his teenage years. He recognized that
the characteristics of the plane could not be established, as Euclid
did, by a definition. Writing in his notebook on July 28, 1797, "I have
demonstrated the possibility of the plane".

Thirty-five years later he elaborated this note to his former classmate
Wolfgang Bolyai:

"In order to treat geometry properly from the beginning, it is essential
to prove the possibility of the plane (Planum); the usual definition
contains too much and already implies an intrinsic hidden theorem. One
must be amazed that every writer from Euclid until the most recent times
have been so careless: but this difficulty is of an entirely different
nature than the difficulty of determining Sigma from S (left from
right-bmd)...

"The impossibility of determining, a priori, between Sigma and S is the
clearest proof that Kant was wrong to claim that space was only the form
of our perception (Anshauung). I have indicated the basis for this in a
little essay...which contains the quintessence of my view on imaginary
numbers in a few pages."

What Gauss was pointing to is that Euclid's definition of a plane
contains the assumption that the straight-lines in it will behave in
certain ways. Gauss rejected this approach. Instead, he understood a
plane to be that surface in which straight-lines obeyed certain provable
relationships, specifically, those relationships that flow from
rotational action. Rotational action does not {define} a plane. Rather,
the plane is that surface in which the rotational action which occurs,
produces certain relationships among straight-lines.

From the standpoint of our earlier examination of Newton's first law,
the straight-line uniform motion of the lonely material point occurs
because it is assumed it is taking place in a flat plane. Newton, like
all magicians, didn't want anyone in his credulous audience to ask, "Is
the universe actually flat?", or even more fundamentally, "Is it
possible for anything to be flat?"

That is the type of question that anyone wishing for civilization to
survive, should begin asking.
