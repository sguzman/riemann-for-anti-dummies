**Riemann for Anti-Dummies Part 28**

BRINGING THE INVISIBLE TO THE SURFACE

When Carl Friedrich Gauss, writing to his former classmate Wolfgang
Bolyai in 1798, criticized the state of contemporary mathematics for its
"shallowness", he was speaking literally -- and, not only about his
time, but also of ours. Then, as now, it had become popular for the
academics to ignore, and even ridicule, any effort to search for
universal physical principles, restricting the province of scientific
inquiry to the, seemingly more practical task, of describing only what's
on the surface. Ironically, as Gauss demonstrated in his 1799 doctoral
dissertation on the fundamental theorem of algebra, what's on the
surface, is revealed only if one knows, what's underneath.

Gauss' method was an ancient one, made famous in Plato's metaphor of the
cave, and given new potency by Johannes Kepler's application of Nicholas
of Cusa's method of On Learned Ignorance. For them, the task of the
scientist was to bring into view, the underlying physical principles,
that could not be viewed directly-the unseen that guided the seen.

Take the illustrative case of Pierre de Fermat's discovery of the
principle, that refracted light follows the path of least time, instead
of the path of least distance followed by reflected light. The principle
of least-distance, is a principle that lies on the surface, and can be
demonstrated in the visible domain. On the other hand, the principle of
least-time, exists "behind", so to speak, the visible, brought into
view, only in the mind. On further reflection, it is clear, that the
principle of least-time, was there all along, controlling, invisibly,
the principle of least-distance. In Plato's terms of reference, the
principle of least-time is of a "higher power", than the principle of
least-distance.

Fermat's discovery is a useful reference point for grasping Gauss'
concept of the complex domain. As Gauss himself stated, unequivocally,
this is not Leonard Euler's formal, superficial concept of "impossible"
numbers (a fact ignored by virtually all of today's mathematical
"experts"). Rather, Gauss' concept of the complex domain, like Fermat's
principle of least-time, brings to the surface, a principle that was
there all along, but hidden from view.

As Gauss emphasized in his jubilee re-working of his 1799 dissertation,
the concept of the complex domain is a "higher domain", independent of
all a priori concepts of space. Yet, it is a domain, "in which one
cannot move without the use of language borrowed from spatial images."

The issue for Gauss, as for Gottfried Leibniz, was to find a general
principle, that characterized what had become known as "algebraic"
magnitudes. These magnitudes, associated initially, with the extension
of lines, squares, and cubes, all fell under Plato's concept of
"dunamais", or "powers".

Leibniz had shown, that while the domain of all "algebraic" magnitudes
consisted of a succession of higher powers, the entire algebraic domain,
was itself dominated by a domain of a still higher power, that Leibniz
called, "transcendental". The relationship of the lower domain of
algebraic magnitudes, to the higher non-algebraic domain of
transcendental magnitudes, is reflected in, what Jacob Bernoulli
discovered about the equiangular spiral. [(See Figure

Leibniz and Johann Bernoulli (Jakob's brother) subsequently demonstrated
that his higher, transcendental domain, exists not as a purely geometric
principle, but originates from the physical action of a hanging chain,
whose geometric shape Christaan Huygens called a catenary. [(See Figure
2.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part28_files_part28figure02.jpeg)
Thus, the physical universe itself demonstrates, that the "algebraic"
magnitudes associated with extension, are not generated by extension.
Rather, the algebraic magnitudes are generated from a physical principle
that exists, beyond simple extension, in the higher, transcendental,
domain.

Gauss, in his proofs of the fundamental theorem of algebra, showed that
even though this transcendental physical principle was outside the
visible domain, it nevertheless cast a shadow that could be made visible
in what Gauss called the complex domain.

As indicated in "Gauss' Declaration of Independence," the discovery of a
general principle for "algebraic" magnitudes was found, by looking
through the "hole" represented by the square roots of negative numbers,
which could appear as solutions to algebraic equations, but lacked any
apparent physical meaning. For example, in the algebraic equation x ^2^
= 4, "x" signifies the side of a square whose area is 4, while, in the
equation x ^2^ = -4, the "x" signifies the side of a square whose area
is -4, an apparent impossibility. For the first case, it is simple to
see, that a line whose length is 2 would be the side of the square whose
area is 4. However, from the standpoint of the algebraic equation, a
line whose length is -2, also produces the desired square.

At first glance, a line whose length is -2 seems as impossible as a
square whose area is -4. Yet, if you draw a square of area 2, you will
see that there are two diagonals, both of which have the power to
produce a new square whose area is 4. These two magnitudes are
distinguished from one another only by their direction, so one is
denoted as 2 and the other as -2.

Now extend this investigation to the cube. In the algebraic equation x
^3^ = 8, there appears to be only one number, 2 which satisfies the
equation, and this number signifies the length of the edge of a cube
whose volume is 8. This appears to be the only solution to this equation
since -2x -- 2x -- 2 = -8.

The anomaly that there are two solutions, which appeared for the case of
a quadratic equation, seems to disappear, in the case of the cube, for
which there appears to be only one solution.

Not so fast. Look at another geometrical problem, that, when stated in
algebraic terms, poses the same paradox--the trisection of an arbitrary
angle. Like the doubling of the cube, Greek geometers could not find a
means for equally trisecting an arbitrary angle, from the principle of
circular action itself. The several methods discovered, (by Archimedes,
Erathosthenes, and others), to find a general principle of trisecting an
angle, were similar to those found, by Plato's collaborators, for
doubling the cube. That is, this magnitude could not be constructed
using only a circle and a straight line, but it required the use of
extended circular action, such as conical action.

But, trisecting an arbitrary angle presents another type of paradox
which is not so evident in the problem of doubling the cube. To
illustrate this, make the following experiment:

Draw a circle. For ease of illustration, mark off an angle of 60
degrees. It is clear that an angle of 20 degrees will trisect this angle
equally. Now add one circular rotation to the 60 degree angle, making an
angle of 420 degrees. It appears these two angles are essentially the
same. But, when 420 is divided by 3 we get an angle of 140 degrees. Add
another 360 degree rotation and we get to the angle of 780 degrees,
which appears to be exactly the same as the angles of 60 and 420
degrees. Yet, when we divide 780 degrees by 3 we get 260 degrees. Keep
this up, and you will see that the same pattern is repeated over and
over again. [(See Figure
3.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part28_files_part28figure03.jpeg)

Looked at from the domain of sense certainty, the angle of 60 degrees
can be trisected by only one angle, that is, an angle of 20 degrees.
Yet, when looked at beyond sense certainty, there are clearly three
angles that "solve" the problem.

This illustrates another "hole" in the algebraic determination of
magnitude. In the case of quadratic equations, there seems to be two
solutions to each problem. In some cases, such x ^2^ = -4, those
solutions seem to have a visible existence. While for the case, x ^2^ =
-4, there are two solutions, 2?-1 and -2?-1, both of which seem to be
"imaginary", having no physical meaning. In the case of cubic equations,
sometimes there are three visible solutions, such as in the case of
trisecting an angle. Yet, in the case of doubling the cube, there
appears to be only one visible solution, but two "imaginary" solutions,
specifically: -1 -- ?3?-1, -1 + ?3?-1. Biquadratic equations, (for
example x ^4^ = 16) , that seem to have no visible meaning themselves,
have four solutions, two "real" (2 and -2) and two "imaginary" (2?-1 and
-2?-1). Things get even more confused for algebraic magnitudes of still
higher powers. This anomaly poses the question that Gauss resolved in
his proof of what he called the fundamental theorem of algebra; that is:
how many solutions are there for any algebraic equation?

The "shallow" minded mathematicians of Gauss' day, such as Euler,
Lagrange, and D'Alembert, took the superficial approach of asserting
that any algebraic equation has as many solutions as it has powers, even
if those solutions were "impossible", such as the square roots of
negative numbers. (This sophist's argument is analogous to saying there
is a difference between man and beast, but, this difference is
meaningless.)

Gauss, in his 1799 dissertation, polemically exposed this fraud for the
sophistry it was. "If someone would say a rectilinear equilateral right
triangle is impossible, there will be nobody to deny that. But, if he
intended to consider such an impossible triangle as a new species of
triangles and to apply to it other qualities of triangles, would anyone
refrain from laughing? That would be playing with words, or rather,
misusing them."

For, Gauss, no magnitude could be admitted, unless its principle of
generation was demonstrated. For magnitudes associated with the square
roots of negative numbers, that principle was the complex physical
action of rotation combined with extension. Magnitudes generated by this
complex action, Gauss called "complex numbers" in which each complex
number denoted a quantity of combined rotational and extended action.
The unit of action in Gauss' complex domain is a circle, which is one
rotation with an extension of unit length. The number 1 signifies one
complete rotation, -1 one half a rotation, ?-1 one fourth a rotation,
and -?-1 three fourths a rotation. [(See Figure
4.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part28_files_part28figure04.jpeg)

These "shadows of shadows", as he called them, were only a visible
reflection of a still higher type of action, that was independent of all
visible concepts of space. These higher forms of action, although
invisible, could nevertheless be brought into view as a projection onto
a surface.

Gauss' approach is consistent with that employed by the circles of
Plato's Academy, as indicated by their use of the term "epiphanea" for
surface, which comes from the same root as the word, "epiphany". The
concept indicated by the word "epiphanea" is, " that on which something
is brought into view".

From this standpoint, Gauss demonstrated, in his 1799 dissertation, that
the fundamental principle of generation of any algebraic equation, of no
matter what power, could be brought into view, "epiphanied", so to
speak, as a surface in the complex domain. These surfaces were visible
representations, not, as in the cases of lines, squares and cubes, of
what the powers produced, but of the principle that produced the powers.

To construct these surfaces, Gauss went outside the simple visible
representation of powers, such as squares and cubes, by seeking a more
general form of powers, as exhibited in the equiangular spiral. [(See
Figure
5.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part28_files_part28figure05.jpeg)
Here, the generation of a power, corresponds to the extension produced
by an angular change. For example, the generation of square powers,
corresponds to the extension that results from a doubling of the angle
of rotation around the spiral.

The generation of cubed powers corresponds to the extension that results
from tripling the angle of rotation. Thus, it is the principle of
squaring that produces square magnitudes, and the principle of cubing
that produces cubics. [(See figure

For example, in [Figure
7](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part28_files_part28figure07.jpeg)
, the complex number z is "squared" when the angle of rotation is
doubled from x to 2x and the length squared from A to A ^2^ . In doing
this, the smaller circle maps twice onto the larger "squared" circle.

And so on for the higher powers. The fourth power maps the smaller
circle four times onto the larger. The fifth power, five times, and so
forth.

This gives a general principle that determines all algebraic powers, as,
from this standpoint, all powers are reflected by the same action. The
only thing that changes with each power, is the number of times that
action occurs. Thus, each power is distinguished from the others, not by
a particular magnitude, but by a topological characteristic.

In his doctoral dissertation, Gauss used this principle to generate
surfaces that expressed the essential characteristic of powers in an
even more fundamental way. Each rotation and extension, produced a
characteristic right triangle. The vertical leg of that triangle is
called the sine and the horizontal leg of that triangle is called the
cosine. [(See Figure
9.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part28_files_part28figure09.jpeg)

There is a cyclical relationship between the sine and cosine which is a
function of the angle of rotation. When the angle is 0, the sine is 0
and the cosine is 1. When the angle is 90 degrees the sine is 1 and the
cosine is 0. Looking at this relationship for an entire rotation, the
sine goes from 0 to 1 to 0 to -1 to 0, while the cosine goes from 1 to 0
to -1 to 0 and back to 1. [(See Figure
10)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part28_files_part28figure10.gif)

varies from 0 to 1, but at the same time, the angle for z ^2^ goes from
0 to 180 degrees, and the sine of z ^2^ varies from 0 to 1 and back to
0. Then as z moves from 90 degrees to 180 degrees, the sine varies from
1 back to 0, but the angle for z ^2^ has moved from 180 degrees to 360
degrees, and its sine has varied from 0 to -1 to 0. Thus, in one half
rotation for z, the sine of z ^2^ has varied from 0 to 1 to 0 to -1 to
0.

In his doctoral dissertation, Gauss represented this complex of actions
as a surface. (See Figures 11, 12, 13.) Each point on the surface is
determined so that its height above the flat plane, is equal to the
distance from the center, times the sine of the angle of rotation, as
that angle is increased by the effect of the power. In other words, the
power of any point in the flat plane, is represented by the height of
the surface above that point. Thus, as the numbers on the flat surface
move outward from the center, the surface grows higher according to the
power. At the same time, as the numbers rotate around the center, the
sine will pass from positive to negative. Since the numbers on the
surface are the powers of the numbers on the flat plane, the number of
times the sine will change from positive to negative, depends on how
much the power changes the angle (double for square powers, triple for
cubics, etc.). Therefore, each surface will have as many "humps" as the
equation has dimensions. Consequently, a quadratic equation will have
two "humps" up and two "humps" down [(Figure

Gauss specified the construction of two surfaces for each algebraic
equation, one based on the variations of the sine and the other based on
the variations of the cosine. [(See figures
14a](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part28_files_part28figure14a.jpeg)

Each of these surfaces will define definite curves where the surfaces
intersect the flat plane. The number of curves will depend on the number
of "humps" which in turn depend on the highest power. Since each of
these surfaces will be rotated 90 degrees to each other, these curves
will intersect each other, and the number of intersections, will
correspond to the number of powers. [(See figures

.) If the flat plane is considered to be 0, these intersections will
correspond to the solutions, or "roots" of the equation. Thus, proving
that an algebraic equation has as many roots as its highest power.

Step back and look at this work. These surfaces were produced, not from
visible squares or cubes, but from the general principle of squaring,
cubing, and higher powers. They represent, metaphorically, a principle
that manifests itself physically, but cannot be seen. By projecting this
principle, the general form of Plato's powers, onto these complex
surfaces, Gauss has brought the invisible into view, and made
intelligible, something that is incomprehensible in the superficial
world of algebraic formalism.

The effort to make intelligible the implications of the complex domain
was a focus for Gauss throughout his life. Writing to his friend Hansen
on December 11, 1825, Gauss said: "These investigations lead deeply into
many others, I would even say, into the Metaphysics of the theory of
space, and it is only with great difficulty can I tear myself away from
the results that spring from it, as, for example, the true metaphysics
of negative and complex numbers. The true sense of the square root of -1
stands before my mind fully alive, but it becomes very difficult to put
it in words; I am always only able to give a vague image that floats in
the air."

It is here, that Riemann begins.

**Riemann for Anti-Dummies Part 28**

BRINGING THE INVISIBLE TO THE SURFACE

When Carl Friedrich Gauss, writing to his former classmate Wolfgang
Bolyai in 1798, criticized the state of contemporary mathematics for its
"shallowness", he was speaking literally -- and, not only about his
time, but also of ours. Then, as now, it had become popular for the
academics to ignore, and even ridicule, any effort to search for
universal physical principles, restricting the province of scientific
inquiry to the, seemingly more practical task, of describing only what's
on the surface. Ironically, as Gauss demonstrated in his 1799 doctoral
dissertation on the fundamental theorem of algebra, what's on the
surface, is revealed only if one knows, what's underneath.

Gauss' method was an ancient one, made famous in Plato's metaphor of the
cave, and given new potency by Johannes Kepler's application of Nicholas
of Cusa's method of On Learned Ignorance. For them, the task of the
scientist was to bring into view, the underlying physical principles,
that could not be viewed directly-the unseen that guided the seen.

Take the illustrative case of Pierre de Fermat's discovery of the
principle, that refracted light follows the path of least time, instead
of the path of least distance followed by reflected light. The principle
of least-distance, is a principle that lies on the surface, and can be
demonstrated in the visible domain. On the other hand, the principle of
least-time, exists "behind", so to speak, the visible, brought into
view, only in the mind. On further reflection, it is clear, that the
principle of least-time, was there all along, controlling, invisibly,
the principle of least-distance. In Plato's terms of reference, the
principle of least-time is of a "higher power", than the principle of
least-distance.

Fermat's discovery is a useful reference point for grasping Gauss'
concept of the complex domain. As Gauss himself stated, unequivocally,
this is not Leonard Euler's formal, superficial concept of "impossible"
numbers (a fact ignored by virtually all of today's mathematical
"experts"). Rather, Gauss' concept of the complex domain, like Fermat's
principle of least-time, brings to the surface, a principle that was
there all along, but hidden from view.

As Gauss emphasized in his jubilee re-working of his 1799 dissertation,
the concept of the complex domain is a "higher domain", independent of
all a priori concepts of space. Yet, it is a domain, "in which one
cannot move without the use of language borrowed from spatial images."

The issue for Gauss, as for Gottfried Leibniz, was to find a general
principle, that characterized what had become known as "algebraic"
magnitudes. These magnitudes, associated initially, with the extension
of lines, squares, and cubes, all fell under Plato's concept of
"dunamais", or "powers".

Leibniz had shown, that while the domain of all "algebraic" magnitudes
consisted of a succession of higher powers, the entire algebraic domain,
was itself dominated by a domain of a still higher power, that Leibniz
called, "transcendental". The relationship of the lower domain of
algebraic magnitudes, to the higher non-algebraic domain of
transcendental magnitudes, is reflected in, what Jacob Bernoulli
discovered about the equiangular spiral. [(See Figure
1.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part28_files_part28figure01.jpeg)

Leibniz and Johann Bernoulli (Jakob's brother) subsequently demonstrated
that his higher, transcendental domain, exists not as a purely geometric
principle, but originates from the physical action of a hanging chain,
whose geometric shape Christaan Huygens called a catenary. [(See Figure
2.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part28_files_part28figure02.jpeg)
Thus, the physical universe itself demonstrates, that the "algebraic"
magnitudes associated with extension, are not generated by extension.
Rather, the algebraic magnitudes are generated from a physical principle
that exists, beyond simple extension, in the higher, transcendental,
domain.

Gauss, in his proofs of the fundamental theorem of algebra, showed that
even though this transcendental physical principle was outside the
visible domain, it nevertheless cast a shadow that could be made visible
in what Gauss called the complex domain.

As indicated in "Gauss' Declaration of Independence," the discovery of a
general principle for "algebraic" magnitudes was found, by looking
through the "hole" represented by the square roots of negative numbers,
which could appear as solutions to algebraic equations, but lacked any
apparent physical meaning. For example, in the algebraic equation x ^2^
= 4, "x" signifies the side of a square whose area is 4, while, in the
equation x ^2^ = -4, the "x" signifies the side of a square whose area
is -4, an apparent impossibility. For the first case, it is simple to
see, that a line whose length is 2 would be the side of the square whose
area is 4. However, from the standpoint of the algebraic equation, a
line whose length is -2, also produces the desired square.

At first glance, a line whose length is -2 seems as impossible as a
square whose area is -4. Yet, if you draw a square of area 2, you will
see that there are two diagonals, both of which have the power to
produce a new square whose area is 4. These two magnitudes are
distinguished from one another only by their direction, so one is
denoted as 2 and the other as -2.

Now extend this investigation to the cube. In the algebraic equation x
^3^ = 8, there appears to be only one number, 2 which satisfies the
equation, and this number signifies the length of the edge of a cube
whose volume is 8. This appears to be the only solution to this equation
since -2x -- 2x -- 2 = -8.

The anomaly that there are two solutions, which appeared for the case of
a quadratic equation, seems to disappear, in the case of the cube, for
which there appears to be only one solution.

Not so fast. Look at another geometrical problem, that, when stated in
algebraic terms, poses the same paradox--the trisection of an arbitrary
angle. Like the doubling of the cube, Greek geometers could not find a
means for equally trisecting an arbitrary angle, from the principle of
circular action itself. The several methods discovered, (by Archimedes,
Erathosthenes, and others), to find a general principle of trisecting an
angle, were similar to those found, by Plato's collaborators, for
doubling the cube. That is, this magnitude could not be constructed
using only a circle and a straight line, but it required the use of
extended circular action, such as conical action.

But, trisecting an arbitrary angle presents another type of paradox
which is not so evident in the problem of doubling the cube. To
illustrate this, make the following experiment:

Draw a circle. For ease of illustration, mark off an angle of 60
degrees. It is clear that an angle of 20 degrees will trisect this angle
equally. Now add one circular rotation to the 60 degree angle, making an
angle of 420 degrees. It appears these two angles are essentially the
same. But, when 420 is divided by 3 we get an angle of 140 degrees. Add
another 360 degree rotation and we get to the angle of 780 degrees,
which appears to be exactly the same as the angles of 60 and 420
degrees. Yet, when we divide 780 degrees by 3 we get 260 degrees. Keep
this up, and you will see that the same pattern is repeated over and
over again. [(See Figure

Looked at from the domain of sense certainty, the angle of 60 degrees
can be trisected by only one angle, that is, an angle of 20 degrees.
Yet, when looked at beyond sense certainty, there are clearly three
angles that "solve" the problem.

This illustrates another "hole" in the algebraic determination of
magnitude. In the case of quadratic equations, there seems to be two
solutions to each problem. In some cases, such x ^2^ = -4, those
solutions seem to have a visible existence. While for the case, x ^2^ =
-4, there are two solutions, 2?-1 and -2?-1, both of which seem to be
"imaginary", having no physical meaning. In the case of cubic equations,
sometimes there are three visible solutions, such as in the case of
trisecting an angle. Yet, in the case of doubling the cube, there
appears to be only one visible solution, but two "imaginary" solutions,
specifically: -1 -- ?3?-1, -1 + ?3?-1. Biquadratic equations, (for
example x ^4^ = 16) , that seem to have no visible meaning themselves,
have four solutions, two "real" (2 and -2) and two "imaginary" (2?-1 and
-2?-1). Things get even more confused for algebraic magnitudes of still
higher powers. This anomaly poses the question that Gauss resolved in
his proof of what he called the fundamental theorem of algebra; that is:
how many solutions are there for any algebraic equation?

The "shallow" minded mathematicians of Gauss' day, such as Euler,
Lagrange, and D'Alembert, took the superficial approach of asserting
that any algebraic equation has as many solutions as it has powers, even
if those solutions were "impossible", such as the square roots of
negative numbers. (This sophist's argument is analogous to saying there
is a difference between man and beast, but, this difference is
meaningless.)

Gauss, in his 1799 dissertation, polemically exposed this fraud for the
sophistry it was. "If someone would say a rectilinear equilateral right
triangle is impossible, there will be nobody to deny that. But, if he
intended to consider such an impossible triangle as a new species of
triangles and to apply to it other qualities of triangles, would anyone
refrain from laughing? That would be playing with words, or rather,
misusing them."

For, Gauss, no magnitude could be admitted, unless its principle of
generation was demonstrated. For magnitudes associated with the square
roots of negative numbers, that principle was the complex physical
action of rotation combined with extension. Magnitudes generated by this
complex action, Gauss called "complex numbers" in which each complex
number denoted a quantity of combined rotational and extended action.
The unit of action in Gauss' complex domain is a circle, which is one
rotation with an extension of unit length. The number 1 signifies one
complete rotation, -1 one half a rotation, ?-1 one fourth a rotation,
and -?-1 three fourths a rotation. [(See Figure
4.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part28_files_part28figure04.jpeg)

These "shadows of shadows", as he called them, were only a visible
reflection of a still higher type of action, that was independent of all
visible concepts of space. These higher forms of action, although
invisible, could nevertheless be brought into view as a projection onto
a surface.

Gauss' approach is consistent with that employed by the circles of
Plato's Academy, as indicated by their use of the term "epiphanea" for
surface, which comes from the same root as the word, "epiphany". The
concept indicated by the word "epiphanea" is, " that on which something
is brought into view".

From this standpoint, Gauss demonstrated, in his 1799 dissertation, that
the fundamental principle of generation of any algebraic equation, of no
matter what power, could be brought into view, "epiphanied", so to
speak, as a surface in the complex domain. These surfaces were visible
representations, not, as in the cases of lines, squares and cubes, of
what the powers produced, but of the principle that produced the powers.

To construct these surfaces, Gauss went outside the simple visible
representation of powers, such as squares and cubes, by seeking a more
general form of powers, as exhibited in the equiangular spiral. [(See
Figure
5.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part28_files_part28figure05.jpeg)
Here, the generation of a power, corresponds to the extension produced
by an angular change. For example, the generation of square powers,
corresponds to the extension that results from a doubling of the angle
of rotation around the spiral.

The generation of cubed powers corresponds to the extension that results
from tripling the angle of rotation. Thus, it is the principle of
squaring that produces square magnitudes, and the principle of cubing
that produces cubics. [(See figure

In [Figure
8](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part28_files_part28figure08.jpeg)
, the same principle is illustrated with respect to cubing. Here the
angle x is tripled to 3x, and the length A is cubed to A ^3^ . In this
case, the smaller circle maps three times onto the larger, "cubed"
circle.

And so on for the higher powers. The fourth power maps the smaller
circle four times onto the larger. The fifth power, five times, and so
forth.

This gives a general principle that determines all algebraic powers, as,
from this standpoint, all powers are reflected by the same action. The
only thing that changes with each power, is the number of times that
action occurs. Thus, each power is distinguished from the others, not by
a particular magnitude, but by a topological characteristic.

In his doctoral dissertation, Gauss used this principle to generate
surfaces that expressed the essential characteristic of powers in an
even more fundamental way. Each rotation and extension, produced a
characteristic right triangle. The vertical leg of that triangle is
called the sine and the horizontal leg of that triangle is called the
cosine. [(See Figure
9.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part28_files_part28figure09.jpeg)

There is a cyclical relationship between the sine and cosine which is a
function of the angle of rotation. When the angle is 0, the sine is 0
and the cosine is 1. When the angle is 90 degrees the sine is 1 and the
cosine is 0. Looking at this relationship for an entire rotation, the
sine goes from 0 to 1 to 0 to -1 to 0, while the cosine goes from 1 to 0
to -1 to 0 and back to 1. [(See Figure
10)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part28_files_part28figure10.gif)

In Figure 9, as z moves from 0 to 90 degrees, the sine of the angle
varies from 0 to 1, but at the same time, the angle for z ^2^ goes from
0 to 180 degrees, and the sine of z ^2^ varies from 0 to 1 and back to
0. Then as z moves from 90 degrees to 180 degrees, the sine varies from
1 back to 0, but the angle for z ^2^ has moved from 180 degrees to 360
degrees, and its sine has varied from 0 to -1 to 0. Thus, in one half
rotation for z, the sine of z ^2^ has varied from 0 to 1 to 0 to -1 to
0.

In his doctoral dissertation, Gauss represented this complex of actions
as a surface. (See Figures 11, 12, 13.) Each point on the surface is
determined so that its height above the flat plane, is equal to the
distance from the center, times the sine of the angle of rotation, as
that angle is increased by the effect of the power. In other words, the
power of any point in the flat plane, is represented by the height of
the surface above that point. Thus, as the numbers on the flat surface
move outward from the center, the surface grows higher according to the
power. At the same time, as the numbers rotate around the center, the
sine will pass from positive to negative. Since the numbers on the
surface are the powers of the numbers on the flat plane, the number of
times the sine will change from positive to negative, depends on how
much the power changes the angle (double for square powers, triple for
cubics, etc.). Therefore, each surface will have as many "humps" as the
equation has dimensions. Consequently, a quadratic equation will have
two "humps" up and two "humps" down [(Figure
11)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part28_files_part28figure11.jpeg)

Gauss specified the construction of two surfaces for each algebraic
equation, one based on the variations of the sine and the other based on
the variations of the cosine. [(See figures

Each of these surfaces will define definite curves where the surfaces
intersect the flat plane. The number of curves will depend on the number
of "humps" which in turn depend on the highest power. Since each of
these surfaces will be rotated 90 degrees to each other, these curves
will intersect each other, and the number of intersections, will
correspond to the number of powers. [(See figures
15a](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part28_files_part28figure15a.jpeg)
and
[15b](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part28_files_part28figure15b.jpeg)
.) If the flat plane is considered to be 0, these intersections will
correspond to the solutions, or "roots" of the equation. Thus, proving
that an algebraic equation has as many roots as its highest power.

Step back and look at this work. These surfaces were produced, not from
visible squares or cubes, but from the general principle of squaring,
cubing, and higher powers. They represent, metaphorically, a principle
that manifests itself physically, but cannot be seen. By projecting this
principle, the general form of Plato's powers, onto these complex
surfaces, Gauss has brought the invisible into view, and made
intelligible, something that is incomprehensible in the superficial
world of algebraic formalism.

The effort to make intelligible the implications of the complex domain
was a focus for Gauss throughout his life. Writing to his friend Hansen
on December 11, 1825, Gauss said: "These investigations lead deeply into
many others, I would even say, into the Metaphysics of the theory of
space, and it is only with great difficulty can I tear myself away from
the results that spring from it, as, for example, the true metaphysics
of negative and complex numbers. The true sense of the square root of -1
stands before my mind fully alive, but it becomes very difficult to put
it in words; I am always only able to give a vague image that floats in
the air."

It is here, that Riemann begins.
