**Riemann for Anti-Dummies Part 44**

PRINCIPLES AND POWERS

Rembrandt van Rijn's masterpiece, [?Aristotle Contemplating a Bust of
Homer?](http://www.koellerer.de/rembrandt.html) , conveys a principle
that leads directly into the deeper implications of Gauss' and Riemann's
complex domain. In the painting, the eyes of both figures are fixed
directly before them, yet, Aristotle's gaze is insufficient to guide
him. To find his way, he reaches forward to touch the likeness of the
poet, who, though blind in life, leads the blocked philosopher in a
direction he would otherwise be incapable of finding.

Like the navigators of ancient maritime civilizations, Rembrandt's Homer
knows that straight-ahead is not necessarily where your eyes point. When
following a course across some wide expanse, these discoverers would
mark their passage by noting the motions of celestial bodies, the which
were charted as changes of positions on the inside of the sphere whose
center was the eyes of the observer. When the observer's position
changed, so did the positions of everything on the sphere, but the
manifold of vision remained a sphere and the eyes of the observer
remained at its center. A stationary observer would note certain changes
in the positions of celestial bodies over the course of a night and from
night to night. An observer moving on the Earth noted these changes,
plus the changes in these changes resulting from his own motion. These
changes, and changes of changes, formed a map in the mind of the
explorer --- not a static map, but a map of the principles that caused
the map to change. It is the map of principles on which all explorers,
from those days to this, place their trust.

While a map, such as one of positions of celestial bodies on the inside
of a sphere, can be represented directly to our senses, a map of
principles can only be represented by the methods exemplified by
Rembrandt's painting. Principles do not appear as objects in the
picture, but as ironies that evoke the formation of their corresponding
ideas in the imagination of the viewer. The scientist in pursuit of
unknown principles, must master the art of recognizing the ironies that
appear, not only from known principles, but those still to be
discovered; the latter emerging as paradoxes. In the case of physical
principles investigated by mathematical images, these paradoxes present
themselves as anomalies, as for example, the emergence of "-1, within
the domain of algebraic equations. The poetic scientist takes the
existence of such anomalies as evidence of a principle yet to be
discovered, and re-thinks how his map must change to include this new
principle. C.F. Gauss measured this type of transformation as a change
in curvature. This work was extended by B. Riemann through his theory of
complex functions, most notably in his major works on the hypergeometric
and abelian functions.

What has failed Rembrandt's Aristotle, is not his eyes, but his map. A
map which has changed by a principle, that on principle, he insists
doesn't exist and cannot be known if it did. Disoriented he's left to
grope in the only direction he knows straight ahead. Fortunately for
him, straight ahead stands the lifeless image of Homer, possessed with
the power to light his way.

**Curvature and Power**

This method of discovery is already evident in the work of Archytas, who
taught that the physics of the universe could be discovered through
investigations of the paradoxes arising in arithmetic, geometry, spheric
(astronomy) and music. His collaborator, Plato, prescribed mastery of
these four branches of one science, as essential for the development of
political leadership.

The solution Archytas provided for doubling the cube exemplifies the
principle. As it was developed more fully in previous pedagogical
discussions [(see Riemann for Anti-Dummies Part
42)](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part44_files/part42.html) the problems
of doubling the line, square and cube, presents us with the existence of
magnitudes of successively higher powers, each of which is associated
with a distinct principle. The Pythagoreans called the power that
doubles the line, arithmetic, and the power that doubles the square
geometric, which they associated with musical intervals as well as
mathematical ones. In their most general form, the arithmetic is
associated with a division of a line, while the geometric is associated
with a division of a circle. (See [figure
1](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part44_files_part44figure01.gif)
and [figure
2](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part44_files_part44figure02.gif)
). From Gauss' standpoint, the change in power from the arithmetic to
geometric is associated with a change in curvature from rectilinear to
circular.

As Hippocrates of Cios indicated, to double the cube requires placing
two geometric means between two extremes. At first blush, this can be
accomplished within the domain of circular action by connecting two
circles to each other. [(See figure
3.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part44_files_part44figure03.gif)
Thus, while the difference between the arithmetic and geometric presents
clearly a change in curvature, the power associated with generating two
geometric means, in first approximation, seems to require only another
circle, hence, no change in curvature.

Yet, when the specific physical problem of doubling the cube is posed,
that is, to find two geometric means between two determined extremes,
(in this case 1 and 2) the existence of the higher power emerges into
the map, as a new type of curvature. [(See animation
1.)](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part44_files/part44animation01) As can
be seen in the diagram, to find two geometric means between 1 and 2, we
must find the place along the circumference of the circle for point P so
that the line OB is one-half of OA. This will occur somewhere along the
pathway traveled by B as P moves around the circle from O to A. But, as
the dotted line which traces that path indicates, this curve is not a
circular arc, and is, in fact, non-uniform with respect to the circle.
Thus, the existence of the yet to be discovered principle, emerges
through the presence of an anomalous change in curvature in our map.

This anomaly takes on an entirely different characteristic in Archytas'
construction using the torus, cylinder and cone. (See [figure
4](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part44_files_part44figure04.gif)
and [animation
2](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part44_files_part44animation02.gif)
.) When the torus and cylinder are generated by rotating one circle
orthogonally around another, the motion of point P is now simultaneously
on two different curves: the circle and the curve formed by the
intersection of the torus and the cylinder. An observer facing the
rotating circle, and who was rotating at exactly the same speed as the
circle, would only see point P move around the circumference of the
circle and would adequately conclude that one geometric mean between two
extremes is a function of circular action alone. But, as indicated
above, the emergence of the non-circular curvature of the path of point
B, would indicate to such an observer, the existence of a new principle
causing the motion of P around the circle. Archytas' construction takes
that new principle into account, by determining the motion of P around
the circle as a function of P's motion along the curve formed by the
intersection of the torus and cylinder. In other words, the circular
rotation of P is only a shadow of a higher form of curvature. That
latter curve expresses both the power to produce one geometric mean
between two extremes, and also, when combined with a cone, to produce
two. [(See figure
4.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part44_files_part44figure04.gif)

Two other examples, presented summarily, will help illustrate the point.
Kepler, like all astronomers before and since, observed the motions of
the planets as circular arcs on the inside of a sphere. His discovery of
the elliptical nature of these orbits occurred, not by suddenly seeing
an ellipse, but by his recognition that the 8′ of an arc deviation
between the circular image of the planet's orbit on the celestial
sphere, and the circular image of the Earth's motion (as reflected in
the motion of the fixed stars on that same celestial sphere), was
evidence of a new principle of planetary motion. The new principle
manifested itself as a change in curvature within his map of principles.
He measured that change in curvature by measuring equal areas instead of
equal arcs, and measuring eccentricities by the proportions that
correspond to musical harmonics.

Similarly, Leibniz and Bernoulli determined that the catenary was not
the parabola that Gallileo wrongly considered it to be, by showing that
the slight deviation of the curvature of the physical hanging chain,
from the curvature of the parabola, was evidence that the chain was
being governed by a different principle than the one Gallileo assumed.
Gallileo demanded, as if in a bi-polar rage, that the chain conform to a
parabolic shape, because he was obsessed with his mathematical formula
that the velocity of a falling body varies according to the square root
of distance fallen. Leibniz and Bernoulli, demonstrated that the chain
was, in truth, obeying a higher principle, the non-algebraic,
transcendental principle associated with Leibniz' discovery of natural
logarithms. A principle that the enraged Gallileo was incapable of
conceiving.

**Gaussian Curvature**

To proceed further it is important to distinguish between commonplace
sense-certainty notions of curvature and the rigorous understanding of
that idea associated with Gauss. The commonplace notion, associated with
the doctrines of Gallileo, Newton, Euler, et al. is that curvature is a
deviation from the straight. But, from the standpoint of the planet, for
example, ?straight?, is a unique elliptical path; or, from the
standpoint of a link in a chain, ?straight? is the catenary curve. It is
only a self-deluded fool who thinks that ?straight? can be determined by
some arbitrary, abstract dictate. Rather, ?straight? is a function of
the set of principles that are determining the action. The addition of a
new principle will change the direction of ?straight?. That change in
principle is measured as a change in curvature.

This is the basis from which Gauss developed his, ?General
Investigations of Curved Surfaces?. He considered a curved surface to be
a set of invariable principles that determined the nature of action on
that surface. As long as that set of principles was not changed, the
nature of the action did not change, even if the surface was bent or
stretched. The nature of the action could only be changed, by a change
in the set of principles that defined the surface. Gauss measured such a
change in principle as a change in curvature, which in turn, determined
what is ?straight? with respect to that set of principles.

Furthermore, Gauss showed, as Leibniz did for curves, that this set of
invariable principles were expressed in the smallest elements of the
surface. Consequently, from the smallest pieces of ?straight? curves
(geodesics) on the surface, and their directions, the curvature of the
surface could be determined. (This aspect of Gauss' work will be
developed in a future pedagogical.)

The method Gauss developed to measure curvature had its roots in
Kepler's method for measuring the elliptical nature of a planetary
orbit, the which was generalized by Leibniz into his development of the
calculus. Confronting the difficulty of measuring the planet's
non-uniform elliptical motion directly, Kepler mapped the constantly
changing speed and direction of the planet onto a circular path, and
measured the planet's action by the relationships among the three
anomalies (eccentric, mean and true) that appeared in the circular map.
(See Summer 1998 Fidelio pp. 29-34).

To measure the curvature of a surface, Gauss extended Kepler's method
from the mapping of a curve onto a circle, to the mapping of a surface
onto a sphere, a method he likened to the ancient use of the celestial
sphere in astronomy. In that case, the motion of celestial bodies are
mapped by the changing directions of lines from the observer to the
body's image on the inside of the celestial sphere. Since whatever
principle is governing the body's motion, is governing the changes in
direction of those lines, measuring the map of those changes in
direction is an indirect measurement of the governing principle.

Gauss recognized that the invariable principles governing a surface
could be expressed by the changing direction of the lines perpendicular
to the surface at every point, called ?normals?. While at any point of a
surface there are an infinite number of tangents [(See Figure
4)](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part44_files/part44figure04) there is a
unique tangent plane for each point, which in turn defines a unique
normal that is perpendicular direction to this tangent plane. The
direction of the normal is a function of the curvature of the surface.
(This is a principle of physical geometry, as exemplified by the
determination of the physical horizon as that direction that is
perpendicular to the pull of gravity.)

The sphere has the unique characteristic that all its normals are also
radial lines. Using this property, every normal to a surface will
correspond to a radial line of a sphere that is pointing in the same
direction. As a normal moves around on a surface, its direction changes.
If a radial line of the sphere is made to change its direction in the
same way as the normal to the surface, it will trace out a curve on the
surface of the sphere, that will reflect the principle governing the
changes in direction of the normal on the surface.

This is illustrated by example in [animation
3](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part44_files_part44animation03.gif)
and [animation
4.](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part44_files_part44animation04.gif)
In these examples, the part of the ellipsoid marked out by the yellow
curve, is mapped onto a sphere. As the red stick moves around the
ellipsoid, its changing direction is determined by the changing
curvature of the surface. These changes are mapped onto a sphere, by the
motion of the blue stick, which emanates from the center of the sphere
and is always pointing in the same direction as the red stick. Gauss
called the area marked out by the blue stick on the sphere the, ?total
or integral curvature? of the surface. If the red stick were moving
along a plane, its direction would not change, and the blue stick would
not move. Since this would obviously mark out no area, Gauss defined a
plane as a surface of zero curvature. The greater the area marked out on
the sphere, the greater the curvature of the surface being mapped.

This can be seen from the above two examples. In animation 3 the red
stick is moving around a large area of the ellipsoid, but because that
region is less curved, its direction doesn't change very much, and the
corresponding area on the sphere is small. Whereas, in animation 4, the
area on the ellipsoid is small, but very curved, so the area marked out
on the sphere is larger.

This total curvature does not change even if the surface is deformed.
For example, try and determine the spherical map of a part of a cone or
a cylinder.

Using this method, Gauss was able to not only measure the ?amount? of
curvature, but he was also able to distinguish types of curvature that
are determined by different sets of principles. For example, [animation
5](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part44_files_part44animation05.gif)
illustrates the mapping of a surface called a ?monkey saddle?. (This
type of surface should be familiar to those who have been working on
Gauss' 1799 proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra.) In this
mapping the curvature of the area denoted by the yellow curve on the
monkey saddle is mapped to the sphere. As the red stick moves once
around the area on the monkey saddle, the blue stick marks out the
spherical area twice. This double covering of the spherical area
indicates that the curvature of the monkey saddle embodies a different
set of principles than the curvature of the ellipsoid.

A still different type of curvature emerges when Gauss' mapping is
applied to a torus as in [animation

, and [animation

In animation 6, a part of the outside of the torus is mapped producing a
corresponding area on the sphere, similar to what happened on the
ellipsoid. But, in animation 7, the area of the torus is situated on
both the inner and outer part. The mapping of these directions produces
a figure eight type of curve on the sphere that crosses itself at the
north pole. Each time the red stick crosses the circle that forms the
boundary between the inner and outer part of the torus, the blue stick
crosses the north pole of the sphere, with one loop of the figure eight
corresponding to the inner part of torus, and the other loop the outer
part. The area on the torus is bounded by a non-intersecting curve,
while its map on the sphere is bounded by an intersecting one. The
presence of this singularity on the spherical map indicates that the
boundary between the inner and outer parts of the torus is a transition
from one type of curvature to another. Consequently, the torus must be
governed by a different set of principles than the ellipsoid or monkey
saddle a set of principles that encompass a transition between two
different types of curvature.

To summarize: for the ellipsoid, the Gaussian mapping produced a simple
area whose size varied with the curvature of the surface. The mapping of
the monkey saddle produced an area that was double covered. The mapping
of the torus, produced a singularity. These mappings not only measure
the ?amount? of total curvature of the part of the surface mapped, but
the appearance of anomalies and singularities in the mapping, indicate
the presence of additional principles of curvature as well.

Like the Chorus in Shakespeare's Henry V, who, alone on an empty stage,
summons the imagination of the audience to envision the real principles
of history and statecraft that are to be depicted, these anomalies and
singularities call the attention of the scientist to imagine the set of
principles that produced them. Therein, is where

**Riemann for Anti-Dummies Part 44**

PRINCIPLES AND POWERS

Rembrandt van Rijn's masterpiece, [?Aristotle Contemplating a Bust of
Homer?](http://www.koellerer.de/rembrandt.html) , conveys a principle
that leads directly into the deeper implications of Gauss' and Riemann's
complex domain. In the painting, the eyes of both figures are fixed
directly before them, yet, Aristotle's gaze is insufficient to guide
him. To find his way, he reaches forward to touch the likeness of the
poet, who, though blind in life, leads the blocked philosopher in a
direction he would otherwise be incapable of finding.

Like the navigators of ancient maritime civilizations, Rembrandt's Homer
knows that straight-ahead is not necessarily where your eyes point. When
following a course across some wide expanse, these discoverers would
mark their passage by noting the motions of celestial bodies, the which
were charted as changes of positions on the inside of the sphere whose
center was the eyes of the observer. When the observer's position
changed, so did the positions of everything on the sphere, but the
manifold of vision remained a sphere and the eyes of the observer
remained at its center. A stationary observer would note certain changes
in the positions of celestial bodies over the course of a night and from
night to night. An observer moving on the Earth noted these changes,
plus the changes in these changes resulting from his own motion. These
changes, and changes of changes, formed a map in the mind of the
explorer --- not a static map, but a map of the principles that caused
the map to change. It is the map of principles on which all explorers,
from those days to this, place their trust.

While a map, such as one of positions of celestial bodies on the inside
of a sphere, can be represented directly to our senses, a map of
principles can only be represented by the methods exemplified by
Rembrandt's painting. Principles do not appear as objects in the
picture, but as ironies that evoke the formation of their corresponding
ideas in the imagination of the viewer. The scientist in pursuit of
unknown principles, must master the art of recognizing the ironies that
appear, not only from known principles, but those still to be
discovered; the latter emerging as paradoxes. In the case of physical
principles investigated by mathematical images, these paradoxes present
themselves as anomalies, as for example, the emergence of "-1, within
the domain of algebraic equations. The poetic scientist takes the
existence of such anomalies as evidence of a principle yet to be
discovered, and re-thinks how his map must change to include this new
principle. C.F. Gauss measured this type of transformation as a change
in curvature. This work was extended by B. Riemann through his theory of
complex functions, most notably in his major works on the hypergeometric
and abelian functions.

What has failed Rembrandt's Aristotle, is not his eyes, but his map. A
map which has changed by a principle, that on principle, he insists
doesn't exist and cannot be known if it did. Disoriented he's left to
grope in the only direction he knows straight ahead. Fortunately for
him, straight ahead stands the lifeless image of Homer, possessed with
the power to light his way.

**Curvature and Power**

This method of discovery is already evident in the work of Archytas, who
taught that the physics of the universe could be discovered through
investigations of the paradoxes arising in arithmetic, geometry, spheric
(astronomy) and music. His collaborator, Plato, prescribed mastery of
these four branches of one science, as essential for the development of
political leadership.

The solution Archytas provided for doubling the cube exemplifies the
principle. As it was developed more fully in previous pedagogical
discussions [(see Riemann for Anti-Dummies Part
42)](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part44_files/part42.html) the problems
of doubling the line, square and cube, presents us with the existence of
magnitudes of successively higher powers, each of which is associated
with a distinct principle. The Pythagoreans called the power that
doubles the line, arithmetic, and the power that doubles the square
geometric, which they associated with musical intervals as well as
mathematical ones. In their most general form, the arithmetic is
associated with a division of a line, while the geometric is associated
with a division of a circle. (See [figure
1](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part44_files_part44figure01.gif)
and [figure
2](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part44_files_part44figure02.gif)
). From Gauss' standpoint, the change in power from the arithmetic to
geometric is associated with a change in curvature from rectilinear to
circular.

As Hippocrates of Cios indicated, to double the cube requires placing
two geometric means between two extremes. At first blush, this can be
accomplished within the domain of circular action by connecting two
circles to each other. [(See figure
3.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part44_files_part44figure03.gif)
Thus, while the difference between the arithmetic and geometric presents
clearly a change in curvature, the power associated with generating two
geometric means, in first approximation, seems to require only another
circle, hence, no change in curvature.

Yet, when the specific physical problem of doubling the cube is posed,
that is, to find two geometric means between two determined extremes,
(in this case 1 and 2) the existence of the higher power emerges into
the map, as a new type of curvature. [(See animation
1.)](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part44_files/part44animation01) As can
be seen in the diagram, to find two geometric means between 1 and 2, we
must find the place along the circumference of the circle for point P so
that the line OB is one-half of OA. This will occur somewhere along the
pathway traveled by B as P moves around the circle from O to A. But, as
the dotted line which traces that path indicates, this curve is not a
circular arc, and is, in fact, non-uniform with respect to the circle.
Thus, the existence of the yet to be discovered principle, emerges
through the presence of an anomalous change in curvature in our map.

This anomaly takes on an entirely different characteristic in Archytas'
construction using the torus, cylinder and cone. (See [figure
4](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part44_files_part44figure04.gif)
and [animation
2](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part44_files_part44animation02.gif)
.) When the torus and cylinder are generated by rotating one circle
orthogonally around another, the motion of point P is now simultaneously
on two different curves: the circle and the curve formed by the
intersection of the torus and the cylinder. An observer facing the
rotating circle, and who was rotating at exactly the same speed as the
circle, would only see point P move around the circumference of the
circle and would adequately conclude that one geometric mean between two
extremes is a function of circular action alone. But, as indicated
above, the emergence of the non-circular curvature of the path of point
B, would indicate to such an observer, the existence of a new principle
causing the motion of P around the circle. Archytas' construction takes
that new principle into account, by determining the motion of P around
the circle as a function of P's motion along the curve formed by the
intersection of the torus and cylinder. In other words, the circular
rotation of P is only a shadow of a higher form of curvature. That
latter curve expresses both the power to produce one geometric mean
between two extremes, and also, when combined with a cone, to produce
two. [(See figure
4.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part44_files_part44figure04.gif)

Two other examples, presented summarily, will help illustrate the point.
Kepler, like all astronomers before and since, observed the motions of
the planets as circular arcs on the inside of a sphere. His discovery of
the elliptical nature of these orbits occurred, not by suddenly seeing
an ellipse, but by his recognition that the 8′ of an arc deviation
between the circular image of the planet's orbit on the celestial
sphere, and the circular image of the Earth's motion (as reflected in
the motion of the fixed stars on that same celestial sphere), was
evidence of a new principle of planetary motion. The new principle
manifested itself as a change in curvature within his map of principles.
He measured that change in curvature by measuring equal areas instead of
equal arcs, and measuring eccentricities by the proportions that
correspond to musical harmonics.

Similarly, Leibniz and Bernoulli determined that the catenary was not
the parabola that Gallileo wrongly considered it to be, by showing that
the slight deviation of the curvature of the physical hanging chain,
from the curvature of the parabola, was evidence that the chain was
being governed by a different principle than the one Gallileo assumed.
Gallileo demanded, as if in a bi-polar rage, that the chain conform to a
parabolic shape, because he was obsessed with his mathematical formula
that the velocity of a falling body varies according to the square root
of distance fallen. Leibniz and Bernoulli, demonstrated that the chain
was, in truth, obeying a higher principle, the non-algebraic,
transcendental principle associated with Leibniz' discovery of natural
logarithms. A principle that the enraged Gallileo was incapable of
conceiving.

**Gaussian Curvature**

To proceed further it is important to distinguish between commonplace
sense-certainty notions of curvature and the rigorous understanding of
that idea associated with Gauss. The commonplace notion, associated with
the doctrines of Gallileo, Newton, Euler, et al. is that curvature is a
deviation from the straight. But, from the standpoint of the planet, for
example, ?straight?, is a unique elliptical path; or, from the
standpoint of a link in a chain, ?straight? is the catenary curve. It is
only a self-deluded fool who thinks that ?straight? can be determined by
some arbitrary, abstract dictate. Rather, ?straight? is a function of
the set of principles that are determining the action. The addition of a
new principle will change the direction of ?straight?. That change in
principle is measured as a change in curvature.

This is the basis from which Gauss developed his, ?General
Investigations of Curved Surfaces?. He considered a curved surface to be
a set of invariable principles that determined the nature of action on
that surface. As long as that set of principles was not changed, the
nature of the action did not change, even if the surface was bent or
stretched. The nature of the action could only be changed, by a change
in the set of principles that defined the surface. Gauss measured such a
change in principle as a change in curvature, which in turn, determined
what is ?straight? with respect to that set of principles.

Furthermore, Gauss showed, as Leibniz did for curves, that this set of
invariable principles were expressed in the smallest elements of the
surface. Consequently, from the smallest pieces of ?straight? curves
(geodesics) on the surface, and their directions, the curvature of the
surface could be determined. (This aspect of Gauss' work will be
developed in a future pedagogical.)

The method Gauss developed to measure curvature had its roots in
Kepler's method for measuring the elliptical nature of a planetary
orbit, the which was generalized by Leibniz into his development of the
calculus. Confronting the difficulty of measuring the planet's
non-uniform elliptical motion directly, Kepler mapped the constantly
changing speed and direction of the planet onto a circular path, and
measured the planet's action by the relationships among the three
anomalies (eccentric, mean and true) that appeared in the circular map.
(See Summer 1998 Fidelio pp. 29-34).

To measure the curvature of a surface, Gauss extended Kepler's method
from the mapping of a curve onto a circle, to the mapping of a surface
onto a sphere, a method he likened to the ancient use of the celestial
sphere in astronomy. In that case, the motion of celestial bodies are
mapped by the changing directions of lines from the observer to the
body's image on the inside of the celestial sphere. Since whatever
principle is governing the body's motion, is governing the changes in
direction of those lines, measuring the map of those changes in
direction is an indirect measurement of the governing principle.

Gauss recognized that the invariable principles governing a surface
could be expressed by the changing direction of the lines perpendicular
to the surface at every point, called ?normals?. While at any point of a
surface there are an infinite number of tangents [(See Figure
4)](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part44_files/part44figure04) there is a
unique tangent plane for each point, which in turn defines a unique
normal that is perpendicular direction to this tangent plane. The
direction of the normal is a function of the curvature of the surface.
(This is a principle of physical geometry, as exemplified by the
determination of the physical horizon as that direction that is
perpendicular to the pull of gravity.)

The sphere has the unique characteristic that all its normals are also
radial lines. Using this property, every normal to a surface will
correspond to a radial line of a sphere that is pointing in the same
direction. As a normal moves around on a surface, its direction changes.
If a radial line of the sphere is made to change its direction in the
same way as the normal to the surface, it will trace out a curve on the
surface of the sphere, that will reflect the principle governing the
changes in direction of the normal on the surface.

This is illustrated by example in [animation

In these examples, the part of the ellipsoid marked out by the yellow
curve, is mapped onto a sphere. As the red stick moves around the
ellipsoid, its changing direction is determined by the changing
curvature of the surface. These changes are mapped onto a sphere, by the
motion of the blue stick, which emanates from the center of the sphere
and is always pointing in the same direction as the red stick. Gauss
called the area marked out by the blue stick on the sphere the, ?total
or integral curvature? of the surface. If the red stick were moving
along a plane, its direction would not change, and the blue stick would
not move. Since this would obviously mark out no area, Gauss defined a
plane as a surface of zero curvature. The greater the area marked out on
the sphere, the greater the curvature of the surface being mapped.

This can be seen from the above two examples. In animation 3 the red
stick is moving around a large area of the ellipsoid, but because that
region is less curved, its direction doesn't change very much, and the
corresponding area on the sphere is small. Whereas, in animation 4, the
area on the ellipsoid is small, but very curved, so the area marked out
on the sphere is larger.

This total curvature does not change even if the surface is deformed.
For example, try and determine the spherical map of a part of a cone or
a cylinder.

Using this method, Gauss was able to not only measure the ?amount? of
curvature, but he was also able to distinguish types of curvature that
are determined by different sets of principles. For example, [animation
5](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part44_files_part44animation05.gif)
illustrates the mapping of a surface called a ?monkey saddle?. (This
type of surface should be familiar to those who have been working on
Gauss' 1799 proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra.) In this
mapping the curvature of the area denoted by the yellow curve on the
monkey saddle is mapped to the sphere. As the red stick moves once
around the area on the monkey saddle, the blue stick marks out the
spherical area twice. This double covering of the spherical area
indicates that the curvature of the monkey saddle embodies a different
set of principles than the curvature of the ellipsoid.

A still different type of curvature emerges when Gauss' mapping is
applied to a torus as in [animation
6](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part44_files_part44animation06.gif)
, and [animation
7.](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part44_files_part44animation07.gif)
In animation 6, a part of the outside of the torus is mapped producing a
corresponding area on the sphere, similar to what happened on the
ellipsoid. But, in animation 7, the area of the torus is situated on
both the inner and outer part. The mapping of these directions produces
a figure eight type of curve on the sphere that crosses itself at the
north pole. Each time the red stick crosses the circle that forms the
boundary between the inner and outer part of the torus, the blue stick
crosses the north pole of the sphere, with one loop of the figure eight
corresponding to the inner part of torus, and the other loop the outer
part. The area on the torus is bounded by a non-intersecting curve,
while its map on the sphere is bounded by an intersecting one. The
presence of this singularity on the spherical map indicates that the
boundary between the inner and outer parts of the torus is a transition
from one type of curvature to another. Consequently, the torus must be
governed by a different set of principles than the ellipsoid or monkey
saddle a set of principles that encompass a transition between two
different types of curvature.

To summarize: for the ellipsoid, the Gaussian mapping produced a simple
area whose size varied with the curvature of the surface. The mapping of
the monkey saddle produced an area that was double covered. The mapping
of the torus, produced a singularity. These mappings not only measure
the ?amount? of total curvature of the part of the surface mapped, but
the appearance of anomalies and singularities in the mapping, indicate
the presence of additional principles of curvature as well.

Like the Chorus in Shakespeare's Henry V, who, alone on an empty stage,
summons the imagination of the audience to envision the real principles
of history and statecraft that are to be depicted, these anomalies and
singularities call the attention of the scientist to imagine the set of
principles that produced them. Therein, is where
