## The Dramatic Power of Abelian Functions

To understand Riemann's treatment of Abelian functions, situate that
discovery within the context of the history in which it arose, reaching
back to the pre-Euclidean Pythagoreans of ancient Greece, and forward to
LaRouche's unique and revolutionary discoveries in the science of
physical economy. Imagine that entire sequence, all at once, as a
dramatic history, leap over time, project the past into the future, the
future into the past, and both into the present, so that centuries of
accomplishment are telescoped into a single, instantaneous thought.

Dynamis

In the opening scene of Plato's {Theatetus} dialogue, Euclides of Megara
informs Terpsion that he has just seen Theatetus being carried to
Athens, near death, after being wounded in the battle at Corinth. This
experience prompts Euclides to recall that Socrates, when near his own
death many years before, had told him that "Theatetus will be a
remarkable man if he lives." Now, contemplating Theatetus's life at its
end, Euclides reports that Socrates had also recounted his first
conversation with Theatetus when the latter was merely a boy. Having
written down Socrates's report, Euclides now reads the history to
Terpsion, the which forms the bulk of Plato's dialogue. As Euclides
tells it, the conversation began with the young Theatetus being praised
by his teacher Theodorus, because the former had surpassed the insights
of the latter. As Theatetus explained, Theodorus had taught him about
the incommensurablity of lines that double, triple, quintuple, etc. a
square, by demonstrating each as a separate and distinct power,
beginning with tripling and ending with seventeen, where, "for some
reason he stopped." But, Theatetus continued, "Since the number of
powers are innumerable, the notion occurred to us of including them all
under one name or species."

Then by reference to a simple geometrical construction, Theatetus
indicates the existence of three distinct {species} of powers: those
that generate lines, those that generate squares and those that generate
solids. Each species comprises an entire manifold of separate and
distinct individual powers. But, each manifold, Theatetus explains, can
be thought of under a single principle: linear, quadratic, or cubic.

Not mentioned directly in the dialogue, but prominent in the background,
is the related discovery of Archytas, who showed that each species is
associated with a different type of physical action: linear, circular
and toroidal, respectively.

These discoveries of Theatetus and Archytas demonstrate a power of the
mind that the Eleatics, Sophists and later, Aristotle, denied existed,
and one that is essential to Riemann's treatment of Abelian functions:
{the capacity of the mind to rise above the finite determinations of
sensible objects, and to recognize the higher universal principles that
determine them}.

As Theatetus demonstrated, it is possible to {know} an entire species of
powers, without having to construct each one individually, by knowing
the principle that determines what each individual power can do e.g.,
double a square-- and what they can't-- double a cube. To know that all
these individual powers are of one species, {and} that the principle
that generates square powers can never generate cubic ones, requires the
mind to rise above the characteristics unique to each individual
magnitude and recognize the nature of the entire species, {and} the
nature of its boundaries.

Aristotle insisted that the human mind did not have this power because,
being limited and mortal, it could not rise from finite determinations
to universal ones:

"Some, as the Pythagoreans and Plato, make the infinite a principle in
the sense of a self- subsistent substance, and not as a mere attribute
of some other thing. Only the Pythagoreans place the infinite among the
objects of sense (they do not regard number as separable from these),
and assert that what is outside the heaven is infinite. Plato, on the
other hand, holds that there is no body outside (the Forms are not
outside because they are nowhere), yet that the infinite is present not
only in the objects of sense but in the Forms also...."

"It is plain, too that the infinite cannot be an actual thing and a
substance and a principle....

"Thus the view of those who speak after the manner of the Pythagoreans
is absurd....

"This discussion, however, involves the more general question, whether
the infinite can be present in mathematical objects and things which are
intelligible and do not have extension, as well as among sensible
objects. Our inquiry (as physicists) is limited to its special subject
matter, the objects of sense, and we have to ask whether there is, or is
not, among them a body which is infinite in the direction of increase."
(Physics, Book 5)

Aristotle's argument is pure sophistry. By {defining} physics to concern
only sensible objects, he excludes all consideration of the universal
principles that generate those objects. Once excluded, he asserts that
such principles play no role in the physical world, because being
infinite, they cannot actually exist.

Contrary to Aristotle, as Theatetus demonstrates, in and through Plato's
dialogue, or as Socrates himself makes clear in numerous other
locations, most notably the {Phaedo}, immortality, not temporal
boundaries, characterizes the human spirit. It can freely transcend the
finite limits of the sensual domain through its power to comprehend, not
only things, such as lines, squares and cubes, but the powers that
generate them. It can transform itself, as Theatetus had shown, from
comprehending different powers individually, as Theodorus had taught, to
comprehending the concept of an entire species of innumerable individual
powers, as he had discovered.

And, as the above account of Plato's account, of Euclides's account, of
Socrates' account, of Theatetus's account of his own discovery
illustrates, the human spirit is not constrained by the mortal life in
which it originates.

Powers that Generate Powers

The method described in the {Theatetus }dialogue is an elementary, but
historically and pedagogically important example of the type of thinking
that underlies Riemann's method, elaborated in his {Theory of Abelian
Functions}. There Riemann is dealing with the principles that generate
higher and higher species of functions, beyond those contemplated by the
Pythagoreans, Theodorus, Theatetus, Archytas and Plato. While Riemann is
looking back on what was anticipated by these great ancient minds, he
does so from the vantage point of the discoveries of Cusa, Kepler,
Leibniz, Gauss and Abel. What these later discoverers demonstrated, was
that the species of powers indicated by Plato et al., were superceded by
a succession of higher species of successively greater power. Riemann,
extending Gauss's concept of the complex domain, created the means to
comprehend the higher power that generates this extended class of higher
powers. His treatment of Abelian functions gives expression to the
quality of mind that can reach beyond the domain of sense perception,
transcend what {appears} to be infinite, recognize the existence of new
species of transcendental powers, and {generate} them as higher forms of
cognition.

To understand Riemann's elaboration of Abelian functions it is crucial
to emphasize the epistemology underlying Cusa's earlier discovery of a
new species of power, by the method that Cusa called {"Learned Ignorance
"}.

Cusa discovered that the incommensurability of the curved to the
straight, as exemplified by the incommensurability between a circle and
its inscribing and circumscribing polygons, indicated the existence of a
new species of power, that transcended those named by Plato, et al. Cusa
proved, and Leibniz later elaborated, that this new species, which
Leibniz called {transcendental}, could generate all lower, {algebraic}
powers, whereas the inverse--to generate the transcendental from the
algebraic--is impossible.

Like Plato, Cusa recognized that to comprehend these higher species of
powers, the mind had to look beyond the boundaries of the domain of
sense-perception, to discover the higher powers that govern it from the
outside:

"I know that what I see perceptibly does not exist from itself. For just
as the sense of sight does not discriminate anything by itself but has
its discriminating from a higher power, so too what is perceptible does
not exist from itself but exists from a higher power. The Apostle said,
"from the creation of the world" because from the visible world as
creature we are elevated to the Creator. Therefore, when in seeing what
is perceptible I understand that it exists from a higher power (since it
is finite, and a finite thing cannot exist from itself; for how could
what is finite have set its own limit?), then I can only regard as
invisible and eternal this Power from which it exists...."
(Actualized-Potential)

Cusa gave his method a mathematical representation, but {not by the
formal, logical deductive procedures of Aristotle, or his later
followers, Euler, Lagrange, and the bigoted Cauchy}. In Cusa's
mathematical representation, what appears to be mathematically infinite,
that is, what is over, or beyond, the finite, (what Cantor would later
call the transfinite) indicates the existence of a new power or
principle acting on the domain of sense-perception from outside. Thus,
pushing finite mathematical expressions to the boundary, and beyond,
reveals the characteristics of those sought for, but yet undiscovered,
higher powers:

"...when we set out to investigate the Maximum metaphorically, we must
leap beyond simple likeness. For since all mathematicals are finite and
otherwise could not even be imagined: if we want to use finite things as
a way for ascending to the unqualifiedly Maximum, we must first consider
finite mathematical figures together with their characteristics and
relations. Next, we must apply these relations, in a transformed way, to
corresponding infinite mathematical figures. Thirdly, we must thereafter
in a still more highly transformed way, apply the relations of these
infinite figures to the simple Infinite, which is altogether independent
even of all figure. At this point our ignorance will be taught
incomprehensibly how we are to think more correctly and truly about the
Most High as we grope by means of a metaphor." (On Learned Ignorance,
Book I.)

Cusa elaborated this metaphor extensively. He examined carefully the
difference between the finite relations of the point, line, polygon and
circle, and their transfinite relations. In the finite, these objects
are each distinct, but transformed into their infinite forms, they
become congruent, indicating the existence of the higher principle from
which their finite relations are unfolded. Thus, the lower, finite forms
are bounded (and governed) by the higher, which, from the standpoint of
the lower, {appears} to be infinitely far away. Therefore, to know
anything about the relationships in the finite, one must view them from
the standpoint of the conditions at that seemingly infinite boundary. As
we will soon illustrate, this relationship reaches a more developed form
in Riemann's treatment of Abelian functions.

Like Plato, Cusa associated this capacity of the human mind, to reach
beyond the boundary of the apparent infinite, and identify new species
of numbers as powers, with the immortality of the soul:

"Likewise, the exhibiting of the mind's immortality can suitably be
pursued from a consideration of number. For since mind is a living
number, i.e., a number that numbers, and since every number is, in
itself, incorruptible (even though number seems variable when it is
considered in matter, which is variable), our mind's number cannot be
conceived to be corruptible. How, then, could the author of number
\[viz., mind\] seem to be corruptible? Moreover, no number can deplete
the mind's power of numbering. Hence, since the motion of the heavens is
numbered by the mind, and since time is the measure of motion, time will
not exhaust the mind's power. Rather, the mind's power will continue on
as the limit, measure, and determination of all things measurable. The
instruments for the motions of the heavens instruments produced by the
human mind attest to its not being the case that motion measures mind
rather than mind's measuring motion. Hence, mind seems to enfold by its
intellective operation all movement of succession, and mind brings forth
from itself rational operations, or rational movement. Thus, mind is the
form of moving. Hence, if when anything is dissolved, the dissolution
occurs by means of motion, then how could the form of moving be
dissolved through motion? Since mind is an intellectual life that moves
itself i.e., is a life that gives rise to the life which is its
understanding how would it fail to be always alive? How could
self-moving motion cease? For mind has life conjoined to it; through
this life it is always alive. (By way of illustration: a sphere is
always round, by virtue of the circle that is conjoined to it.) If
mind's composition is as the composition of number, which is composed of
itself, how would mind be dissolvable into not-mind?...

...thus, he who numbers unfolds and enfolds. Mind is an {image} of
Eternity, but time is an {unfolding} of Eternity..."(The Laymen on Mind)

Unlike the heathen Aristotle, for Cusa, the infinite is not outside the
universe. What appears to be infinitely far away from the standpoint of
sense-perception, is only the boundary marking the transition to the
unseen, but efficient, domain of universal physical principles. Those
principles reach through that boundary, into the visible domain,
determining the characteristics of action within it. The mind, in turn,
reaches back, transcending the apparently infinite, and discovering the
characteristics of those principles. {Thus, the appearance of the
infinite in mathematical expressions, simply indicates the necessity for
a transformation of the mind's idea a transformation that makes a
universal principle that had appeared to be inaccessible, known.}

The Physical Generation of Powers

From Cusa, the road to the discovery of those higher species of
transcendental powers that are the subject of Riemann's work, goes
through the investigations of Gauss and Abel who were provoked by:

--Kepler's discovery that the principle of universal gravitation
generated planetary orbits that were essentially elliptical, and;

--Leibniz's determination that these orbits reflected a universal
principle of physical least- action expressed by the catenary curve.

In rejecting the Aristotelean formalism of Ptolemy, Copernicus, and
Brahe, and basing his investigation only on physical considerations,
Kepler was compelled to reject the mathematically simpler circular
orbits for the physically determined elliptical ones. This produced a
crisis, because, whereas in a circular orbit, there is an
incommensurability between the angle and the sine, in an elliptical
orbit, there is an incommensurability between the arc and the angle as
well. Kepler's attempts to measure elliptical motion from the standpoint
of the circular functions (i.e., as the connected action of a
rectilinear triangle and a circular arc), produced the paradox known as
"The Kepler Problem". Kepler developed a method to approximate this
measurement for practical purposes but, for him, this was insufficient.
Kepler was not a pragmatist. Though practical solutions were vital to
his work, Kepler was insistent on knowing the principle as well. When
knowledge of that principle eluded him, Kepler demanded that future
geometers solve the problem, insuring that even his own death would not
end his quest.

While Kepler did not discover the higher principle of elliptical motion,
he indicated where to look. In his related work on optics, Kepler
proposed to look at the ellipse as merely one phase in a single function
that generated all the conic sections. He expressed this geometrically
through his famous projection that carried the circle into a hyperbola.
[(See Figure
1.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part54_files_part54figure01.gif)
The emergence of an apparently infinite boundary between the ellipse and
the hyperbola, within an otherwise continuous function, indicated the
direction in which this undiscovered principle could be found.

The appearance of the infinite boundary between the ellipse and the
hyperbola reflects, of course, the double cone construction of the conic
section. On one side of the "infinite", the circle, ellipse and
parabola, only the lower cone is cut by an intersecting plane. It is
when that plane touches the upper cone, that the hyperbola is formed.

Leibniz, through an application of his infinitesimal calculus, showed
that the curvature of the hanging chain can be expressed as the
arithmetic mean between two exponential curves. [(See Figure
3.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part54_files_part54figure03.gif)
These exponential curves do not exist in the perceptible domain of the
hanging chain. Nevertheless, they express a characteristic of the
{physical manifold} that is acting, from outside the domain of
sense-perception, on the chain, in every infinitesimal interval.

As Leibniz emphasized, these exponential curves express that
transcendental species of power that generates all the lower algebraic
ones. [(See Figure

This same relationship is also expressed, in different forms, by the
equiangular spiral and the hyperbola. (See [Figure

In connection with this investigation of the catenary, Leibniz coined
the term {"function"} to denote a specified transformation. So, for
example, the exponential function transforms arithmetic relations into
the geometric ones. Its inverse, the logarithmic function, transforms
geometric relations into arithmetic ones. As the arithmetic mean between
two exponential functions, the catenary, therefore, is a function of two
functions.

When Leibniz pushed this investigation to its boundary, by attempting to
determine the function that generates the logarithms of negative
numbers, he met the appearance of the square root of -1, which he
identified as existing in a real, but "imaginary" domain.

That Undiscovered Country

Thus, the young Gauss, confronted with the appearance of what Leibniz
called, "a fine and wonderful recourse to the divine spirit, almost an
amphibian somewhere between being and non-being", granted the square
roots of negative numbers their "full civil rights". From this
standpoint he reexamined the "Kepler Problem", and discovered that
elliptical motion was governed by a higher species of transcendental,
that had been anticipated by, but not known to Kepler or Leibniz.

The physical significance of complex numbers emerged quite naturally
from Leibniz's catenary principle and the paradox of negative
logarithms. [(See Figure
6.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part54_files_part54figure06.gif)

Since the catenary is formed as the arithmetic mean between {two}
exponential curves, Leibniz sought the function that generated both,
which could be expressed as that which generated their geometric mean.
But, there is no continuous transformation, within the plane of the
catenary, and the exponentials hanging behind it, that can transform one
exponential into the other. The only physical action that has the power
to produce both curves, is a rotation orthogonal to the plane of the
catenary. [(See Figure
7.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part54_files_part54figure07.gif)

If the direction of one exponential is designated as positive and the
other direction negative, the geometric mean between them is expressed
as the square root of a negative number. [(See Figure

This gives rise to the following paradox: In the plane of the two
exponentials, the geometric mean between them is a straight-line. But,
when looked at from the higher standpoint of physical action, that
straight-line is actually the axis of rotation from which is generated
an entire surface orthogonal to the plane of the chain. Thus, to
represent the physical action of the chain, the unseen exponentials that
hang behind it, and the unseen principle that generates the exponentials
themselves, requires both the plane of the chain, and the plane of the
action orthogonal to it.

Gauss conceived the idea of representing this complex domain on one
surface. That surface acts as a stage for the imagination on which
{both} the physical action and the universal principles that govern it
can be represented.

The two exponentials in the plane of the catenary are generated by an
action that is completely outside their visible domain. The point at
which the axis of rotation touches the surface generated by that
rotation, i.e. the center of the circle formed by that rotation, is the
only intersection between the visible domain and the surface on which
the principle of generation is represented.

Just as on the Classical stage, a single line, ("Its Greek to me.") in
the context of the drama, can indicate an historical transformation of
an entire culture, on the surface representing the complex domain, an
entire principle, in the context of a complex function, can be
represented by the action at a single point.

Hidden Harmonies Become Heard

By adopting Gauss's approach, Riemann was able to create a stage, on
which an innumerable class of transcendentals of successively higher
power could be brought within the scope of the imagination. Each new
species of transcendental, beginning with the simplest species of
transcendentals discovered by Cusa, to the elliptical functions of
Gauss, to those higher species discovered by Abel, is distinguished from
its predecessor by the addition of a new principle. Under Riemann's
idea, each new principle is represented by a change in the geometrical
characteristics, {the topology} of the surface.

Here Riemann adopted Leibniz's method of {analysis situs} as applied by
Gauss in his 1799 dissertation on the fundamental theorem of algebra.
Gauss showed that formal algebra could not distinguish the implications
of a change from one power to another. This is reflected, as Gauss
ironically emphasized, in the inability, from the standpoint of formal
algebra, to answer algebra's most important question: "How many
solutions are there for a given algebraic expression?" It was only when
these expressions were thought of geometrically, as surfaces, that their
essential characteristics could be made known. Then, it was clear, that
the highest power of the function determined a topological
characteristic (the number of "humps") that was independent of any
variations in the lower powers or the coefficients of that function.

Thus, Gauss's employment of Leibniz's geometry of position, {analysis
situs}, expressed the epistemological relationship that the principle
associated with the highest power dominated all lower ones. A change in
the degree of power is, therefore, a change in the governing principle,
and is expressed by a transformation of the entire geometry of the
surface. Thus, the essential characteristics of an entire species of
algebraic functions could be known completely, without the useless
formal calculations of Euler, Lagrange and D'Alembert.

To illustrate Riemann's approach, we begin with a look at the simplest
species of transcendental, those associated with the circular,
hyperbolic and exponential functions. As Leibniz and Bernoulli
demonstrated the catenary, expressing the universal physical principle
of least-action, embodied all three of these functions in one single
physical action.

However, from the standpoint of the "simple" domain, these three
functions seemed to have entirely different characteristics. For
example, the circle and the hyperbola are conic sections, the
exponential is not. In the visible domain, the circle is periodic, the
hyperbola and exponential appear infinitely extended.

Leibniz imagined that a higher principle united all three
transcendentals, but he never elaborated his idea. The sophisticated,
but Leibniz-hating Euler, tried to obscure Leibniz's insight with a
series of algebraic formalisms, (such as his infamous equations: e
^i\*Pi^ -1=0; and e ^i\*x^ =cos\[x\]+i\*sin\[x\]) which have bedeviled
generations of students and scientists to this day.

Yet through Gauss's and Riemann's physical conception of the complex
domain it can be easily demonstrated that these three functions express
one unified species of transcendentals, and are all derived from the
complex exponential. Gauss recognized this as early as August 14, 1796,
writing in his notebook: "By the way, (a+b\*?-1) ^m+n\*?-1^ has been
explained".

Here Gauss indicates he has extended the idea of the exponential
function to the complex domain. As noted above, the exponential function
is the transformation of arithmetic relationships into geometric ones.
In the "simple" domain, this appears geometrically as the characteristic
curvature of a single curve, as, for example, the equiangular spiral,
hyperbola or exponential curve. In Gauss's complex domain, the complex
exponential function transforms the arithmetic relations of an entire
surface into geometric ones, transforming all curves into new ones.

This can be seen most easily from the geometrical example in Gauss's
Copenhagen Prize Essay on conformal mapping (on which Riemann relied.).
There Gauss shows that the complex exponential function corresponds to
the stereographic projection of a sphere onto a plane a projection first
developed by the ancient Greeks in connection with the mapping of the
celestial sphere. [(See Figure
10.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part54_files_part54figure10.gif)

Under this projection, the circles of "latitude" on the sphere are
projected onto concentric circles on the plane, whose radii are
expanding exponentially. Circles of "longitude" on the sphere are
transformed into radial lines on the plane.

Don't think of this transformation as a static image. Think of it from
the standpoint of physical action. Think of the motion along a circle of
latitude on the sphere. What is the corresponding motion on the plane?
Think of the motion along a circle of longitude on the sphere. What is
the corresponding motion in the plane? Think of motion along a path of
equal heading on the sphere (loxodrome). What is the corresponding
motion along in the plane? When you think of it in this way, you can
begin to see how all relationships on the sphere are transformed,
lawfully, into different relationships on the plane.

Here a crucial new idea emerges that cannot be seen in the "simple"
domain. What appeared to be "infinitely" long radial lines of the plane,
become "finite" circles of longitude on the sphere. Action on the plane
that appears to go off into the "infinite" approaches a single point on
the sphere. From the standpoint of Cusa, if the terminus of all the
radial lines in the plane is thought of as the "infinite" circle, its
image is a single point on the sphere. In other words, the principle
bounding the action on the plane, that appears to be infinite and
unknowable, is brought into the imagination, by the action associated
with a single point on the sphere. Thus, in the complex domain, we can
faithfully represent Cusa's notion that in the infinite, the center and
circumference, minimum and maximum, coincide.

It is important to emphasize, however, that physical action, such as the
hanging chain, is never "infinite". The catenary is the curve of a chain
hanging between two positions. Thus, "this side of the infinite", the
physical exponential is always bounded. It is the universal principle
that it reflects that is {transfinite}.

Another characteristic now comes into view that otherwise remained
hidden with the "simple" view of the exponential. In the simple domain,
the exponential curve appears aperiodic But, this is only an illusion
caused by viewing the exponential too simply. As can be seen in the
image of the stereographic projection, the radial lines are unbounded,
but the circles of latitude are periodic. (As you can imagine, this
period is real. It is Euler's fraud to insist that the period of the
complex exponential is "imaginary".)

The hidden periodicity of the complex exponential can be seen more
dramatically when viewed as a transformation of an orthogonal grid of
curves on a plane, or, as Riemann suggested, on the surface of a very
large sphere. [(See Figure
11.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part54_files_part54figure11.gif)

Here all "straight" lines are transformed into a network of equiangular
spirals, bounded by spirals with maximum rotation and minimum extension
(i.e., circles), and spirals with maximum extension and minimum rotation
(i.e., radial lines).

Think of this image from the standpoint of action. Under the
transformation of the complex exponential, motion along a "straight"line
is transformed into spiral motion, including the extreme cases of the
circles and the radial lines. The non-periodic motion along the vertical
lines is transformed into periodic circular action. [(See Figure

The aperiodic motion along horizontal lines is transformed into motion
along the exponentially extending radii, which remains aperiodic. Motion
along a diagonal line is transformed into ever expanding spiral action.

Now compare this result with what was noted above concerning the two
exponential curves associated with the hanging chain. In the visible
domain, this action is aperiodic. However, the rotation orthogonal to
the plane of the hanging chain has a periodicity. Here we can recognize
the physical reality of the exponential function's "imaginary" period.

As Leibniz and Bernoulli demonstrated in their work on the catenary, the
hyperbolic functions are functions of the exponential: the hyperbolic
cosine is one-half the sum of two exponentials and the hyperbolic sine
is one-half the difference of two exponentials. (See [Figure
14.](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part54_files/part54figure14a.gif) )

As Leibniz also insisted, the circular functions are also functions of
the exponential, but only in a different, "imaginary", domain. [(See
Figure

The circular cosine is one-half the sum of two complex exponentials,
while the circular sine is one-half the difference of two complex
exponentials.

When viewed from the standpoint of Gauss's and Riemann's complex domain,
all these functions can be expressed by the same type of action: the
arithmetic mean between two complex exponentials moving in opposite
directions, as illustrated by the circles in the accompanying animation.
(See [Figure

.) Together, the hyperbolic and circular functions form the four
different variations of the same type of action. Thus, generated by the
same type of action, they are all of the same species of transcendental.

The Elliptical Transcendentals

The young Gauss, contemplating the origin of the "Kepler Problem", was
puzzled by the inability to express elliptical motion by the circular,
hyperbolic or exponential functions. But, when he looked at a similar
problem, that of the lemniscate, from the standpoint of the complex
domain, he discovered a different species of transcendental that was
expressed by elliptical motion. When the characteristics of that species
are viewed on Riemann's stage, the difference between the elliptical and
the lower transcendentals becomes obvious.

While Gauss did not state it this way directly, his January 1797
decision to begin serious investigation of the lemnsicate alludes to the
clue suggested earlier by Kepler's concept of the conic sections.

As noted above, Kepler thought of all the conic sections as being
generated from one continuous function. The emergence of an infinite
boundary, between the ellipse and the hyperbola, reflects the transition
to the inclusion of the upper cone in the double conical function. Thus,
the entire function involves action in two different directions
(parallel and perpendicular to the base of the cones). When thought of
from the standpoint of Cusa, the appearance of the infinite signifies
that a higher, undiscovered principle exists that encompasses both the
perpendicular and parallel action as one. It is from this higher type of
function that Kepler's conic section function is unfolded.

This function must have the same relationship to the circular and
hyperbolic functions as those functions have to the algebraic. That is,
the higher species must have the capacity to generate the lower, but not
the inverse. This is akin to the relationship between the quadratic and
cubic species of magnitudes as viewed from the standpoint of Archytas.
The principle of toroidal motion that generates cubic magnitudes can
generate the quadratics as well, but not the inverse.

Now what is the nature of these elliptical transcendentals and how can
we discover it? Let's reconstruct Gauss's investigation of the
lemniscate from the standpoint of the clue supplied by Kepler, and the
later solution supplied by Riemann.

That the lemniscate would become the focus of Gauss's attention, flows
quite naturally from the extension of Kepler's concept of the conic
sections into the complex domain. As presented in previous installments
of this series, the lemniscate can be generated as the inversion of the
hyperbola in a circle, or the stereographic projection of a hyperbola
onto a sphere. (See [Figure
17](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part54_files_part54figure17.gif)
and [Figure
18](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part54_files_part54figure18.gif)
.) From the standpoint of these two projections, it can be seen that the
circle is the geometric mean between the hyperbola and the lemniscate.
Thus, we seek a higher function that transforms the hyperbola, through
the circle, into the lemnsicate.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

It is important to take note of the method of inversion employed here.
In the case of the two exponential curves and the catenary, the
geometric mean between the two exponential curves could not be found
within the visible domain of the curves and the hanging chain. The
search for the principle that would generate both exponentials led us
into the complex domain. In the case of the conic sections, Kepler's
function generates one from the other. But the appearance of the
infinite in the middle of the function coaxes us to consider a higher
function. That function generates, not another conic section, but a
lemnsicate.

Now look at Kepler's function, as he envisioned it projected onto a
plane, and, from Riemann's standpoint, projected onto a sphere. [(See
Figure
19.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part54_files_part54figure19.gif)
In the former case, the circle is transformed into an ellipse, which is
transformed into an hyperbola, and then into a line. In the latter, the
circle is transformed into a projected ellipse, which is transformed
into a lemnsicate, and then into two coincidental hemispheric circles.

Thus, to grasp the higher principle we have to think of both functions
happening simultaneously: the one on the stage of the plane that is
generating the conic sections, and the one on the stage of the sphere,
that is generating a lemniscate. But from our vantage point we see both
on {one} stage the stage of the complex domain.

Note that the infinite boundary that appears in the plane, appears in
the spherical projection as the crossing point of the lemniscate. This
presence of the {transfinite}, represented as a single point in the
lemniscate, signifies the existence of an additional principle, that is
outside the domain of the conic sections, but, {inside} the domain in
which the lemnsicate resides. As noted in a previous installment, Gauss
showed that the crossing point on the lemniscate also reflects the
boundary between the regions of positive and negative curvature on the
torus. [(See Figure
20.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part54_files_part54figure20.gif)

Does the presence of this new principle indicate that the lemniscate is
associated with a different species of transcendental than the circular
or hyperbolic functions? Gauss said yes, and Riemann provided the basis
to recognize this geometrically.

Gauss recognized the existence of this added principle in the lemniscate
by the double periodicity of the lemnsicatic functions. Where, for
example, the circular functions are periodic with respect to the
interval 0 to 2Pi, the lemnsicatic functions are periodic with respect
to the interval 1 to -1 {and} the interval /-1 and -/-1. (See Riemann
for Anti-Dummies 52.)

Gauss expressed the geometrical characteristic of double periodicity in
his work on bi-quadratic residues, which he published in 1832. However,
its discovery was much earlier, as indicated by his notebook entry, "I
have discovered a remarkable connection between the lemniscate and
bi-quadratic residues".

That connection is illustrated by the geometrical representation Gauss
gave, with respect to simple and complex moduli, in his {Second Treatise
on Bi-Quadratic Residues}. There Gauss shows that for real numbers, the
modulus can be expressed geometrically by a simple line segment or
curve. (See [Figure

However, in the complex domain, a complex modulus is expressed by a
parallelogram on a surface. [(See Figure

This same geometrical distinction, as Gauss noted, also appears in
comparing the lemniscate with the circular functions in the complex
domain. In the case of the circular, hyperbolic or exponential
functions, motion in one direction was periodic, while motion
perpendicular to it was not. As illustrated above, this type of motion
could be mapped onto a surface such as a sphere.

However, for the lemnsicate, the motion is periodic in two directions
simultaneously. (See

Such motion can not be represented on Riemann's sphere, where one
direction, such as the circles of latitude, are periodic, but, in the
orthogonal direction, the circles of longitude, are not periodic without
crossing the infinite.

Riemann showed that the elliptical functions could only be expressed on
a surface that allowed for two distinct periodic curves. Such a surface
can be constructed, Riemann showed, by taking the parallelogram of
Gauss's complex modulus and connecting the opposite sides to each other,
forming a surface with the topology of a torus. [(See Figure
24.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part54_files_part54figure24.gif)

On a torus, there are two distinct curves, one that goes around the
outside, and one that goes through the hole. [(See Figure
25.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part54_files_part54figure25.gif)

Riemann emphasized that the torus is an entirely different type of
surface than a sphere. {And, there is no continuous function that can
transform a sphere into a torus, without the introduction of a new
principle. Once introduced, that new principle effects a complete
transformation of all relationships on that surface.}

Through this investigation into the distinction between the higher
species of elliptical transcendentals and the lower species, we are able
to recognize that the difference between these two species of
transcendentals reflects a fundamental change in the number of
principles acting through each species. As Abel showed, an entire class
of transcendentals can be constructed of successively higher power . In
Riemann's elaboration, the change from one species to the higher,
conforms to a transformation from a domain of "n" principles to a domain
of "n+1" principles. As in Archytas's construction for the doubling of
the cube, or Gauss's method of his 1799 dissertation on the fundamental
theorem of algebra, such transformations can be made intelligible on the
stage of the complex domain, as a discontinuous transformation in the
{topology} of that domain.

More importantly, however, armed with this new power to make
intelligible the generation of higher species of transcendentals, we can
now envision the transformation that must occur, in any domain when a
new principle is added. Thus, through the willful employment of the
mind's power of discovery, we can reach past the boundary of what seems
to be infinite, and bring new principles into our conscious possession.

And this brings us back to Theatetus, who, as a young boy, shows us
today, that an entire species can be known, completely without
calculation.

## The Dramatic Power of Abelian Functions

To understand Riemann's treatment of Abelian functions, situate that
discovery within the context of the history in which it arose, reaching
back to the pre-Euclidean Pythagoreans of ancient Greece, and forward to
LaRouche's unique and revolutionary discoveries in the science of
physical economy. Imagine that entire sequence, all at once, as a
dramatic history, leap over time, project the past into the future, the
future into the past, and both into the present, so that centuries of
accomplishment are telescoped into a single, instantaneous thought.

Dynamis

In the opening scene of Plato's {Theatetus} dialogue, Euclides of Megara
informs Terpsion that he has just seen Theatetus being carried to
Athens, near death, after being wounded in the battle at Corinth. This
experience prompts Euclides to recall that Socrates, when near his own
death many years before, had told him that "Theatetus will be a
remarkable man if he lives." Now, contemplating Theatetus's life at its
end, Euclides reports that Socrates had also recounted his first
conversation with Theatetus when the latter was merely a boy. Having
written down Socrates's report, Euclides now reads the history to
Terpsion, the which forms the bulk of Plato's dialogue. As Euclides
tells it, the conversation began with the young Theatetus being praised
by his teacher Theodorus, because the former had surpassed the insights
of the latter. As Theatetus explained, Theodorus had taught him about
the incommensurablity of lines that double, triple, quintuple, etc. a
square, by demonstrating each as a separate and distinct power,
beginning with tripling and ending with seventeen, where, "for some
reason he stopped." But, Theatetus continued, "Since the number of
powers are innumerable, the notion occurred to us of including them all
under one name or species."

Then by reference to a simple geometrical construction, Theatetus
indicates the existence of three distinct {species} of powers: those
that generate lines, those that generate squares and those that generate
solids. Each species comprises an entire manifold of separate and
distinct individual powers. But, each manifold, Theatetus explains, can
be thought of under a single principle: linear, quadratic, or cubic.

Not mentioned directly in the dialogue, but prominent in the background,
is the related discovery of Archytas, who showed that each species is
associated with a different type of physical action: linear, circular
and toroidal, respectively.

These discoveries of Theatetus and Archytas demonstrate a power of the
mind that the Eleatics, Sophists and later, Aristotle, denied existed,
and one that is essential to Riemann's treatment of Abelian functions:
{the capacity of the mind to rise above the finite determinations of
sensible objects, and to recognize the higher universal principles that
determine them}.

As Theatetus demonstrated, it is possible to {know} an entire species of
powers, without having to construct each one individually, by knowing
the principle that determines what each individual power can do e.g.,
double a square-- and what they can't-- double a cube. To know that all
these individual powers are of one species, {and} that the principle
that generates square powers can never generate cubic ones, requires the
mind to rise above the characteristics unique to each individual
magnitude and recognize the nature of the entire species, {and} the
nature of its boundaries.

Aristotle insisted that the human mind did not have this power because,
being limited and mortal, it could not rise from finite determinations
to universal ones:

"Some, as the Pythagoreans and Plato, make the infinite a principle in
the sense of a self- subsistent substance, and not as a mere attribute
of some other thing. Only the Pythagoreans place the infinite among the
objects of sense (they do not regard number as separable from these),
and assert that what is outside the heaven is infinite. Plato, on the
other hand, holds that there is no body outside (the Forms are not
outside because they are nowhere), yet that the infinite is present not
only in the objects of sense but in the Forms also...."

"It is plain, too that the infinite cannot be an actual thing and a
substance and a principle....

"Thus the view of those who speak after the manner of the Pythagoreans
is absurd....

"This discussion, however, involves the more general question, whether
the infinite can be present in mathematical objects and things which are
intelligible and do not have extension, as well as among sensible
objects. Our inquiry (as physicists) is limited to its special subject
matter, the objects of sense, and we have to ask whether there is, or is
not, among them a body which is infinite in the direction of increase."
(Physics, Book 5)

Aristotle's argument is pure sophistry. By {defining} physics to concern
only sensible objects, he excludes all consideration of the universal
principles that generate those objects. Once excluded, he asserts that
such principles play no role in the physical world, because being
infinite, they cannot actually exist.

Contrary to Aristotle, as Theatetus demonstrates, in and through Plato's
dialogue, or as Socrates himself makes clear in numerous other
locations, most notably the {Phaedo}, immortality, not temporal
boundaries, characterizes the human spirit. It can freely transcend the
finite limits of the sensual domain through its power to comprehend, not
only things, such as lines, squares and cubes, but the powers that
generate them. It can transform itself, as Theatetus had shown, from
comprehending different powers individually, as Theodorus had taught, to
comprehending the concept of an entire species of innumerable individual
powers, as he had discovered.

And, as the above account of Plato's account, of Euclides's account, of
Socrates' account, of Theatetus's account of his own discovery
illustrates, the human spirit is not constrained by the mortal life in
which it originates.

Powers that Generate Powers

The method described in the {Theatetus }dialogue is an elementary, but
historically and pedagogically important example of the type of thinking
that underlies Riemann's method, elaborated in his {Theory of Abelian
Functions}. There Riemann is dealing with the principles that generate
higher and higher species of functions, beyond those contemplated by the
Pythagoreans, Theodorus, Theatetus, Archytas and Plato. While Riemann is
looking back on what was anticipated by these great ancient minds, he
does so from the vantage point of the discoveries of Cusa, Kepler,
Leibniz, Gauss and Abel. What these later discoverers demonstrated, was
that the species of powers indicated by Plato et al., were superceded by
a succession of higher species of successively greater power. Riemann,
extending Gauss's concept of the complex domain, created the means to
comprehend the higher power that generates this extended class of higher
powers. His treatment of Abelian functions gives expression to the
quality of mind that can reach beyond the domain of sense perception,
transcend what {appears} to be infinite, recognize the existence of new
species of transcendental powers, and {generate} them as higher forms of
cognition.

To understand Riemann's elaboration of Abelian functions it is crucial
to emphasize the epistemology underlying Cusa's earlier discovery of a
new species of power, by the method that Cusa called {"Learned Ignorance
"}.

Cusa discovered that the incommensurability of the curved to the
straight, as exemplified by the incommensurability between a circle and
its inscribing and circumscribing polygons, indicated the existence of a
new species of power, that transcended those named by Plato, et al. Cusa
proved, and Leibniz later elaborated, that this new species, which
Leibniz called {transcendental}, could generate all lower, {algebraic}
powers, whereas the inverse--to generate the transcendental from the
algebraic--is impossible.

Like Plato, Cusa recognized that to comprehend these higher species of
powers, the mind had to look beyond the boundaries of the domain of
sense-perception, to discover the higher powers that govern it from the
outside:

"I know that what I see perceptibly does not exist from itself. For just
as the sense of sight does not discriminate anything by itself but has
its discriminating from a higher power, so too what is perceptible does
not exist from itself but exists from a higher power. The Apostle said,
"from the creation of the world" because from the visible world as
creature we are elevated to the Creator. Therefore, when in seeing what
is perceptible I understand that it exists from a higher power (since it
is finite, and a finite thing cannot exist from itself; for how could
what is finite have set its own limit?), then I can only regard as
invisible and eternal this Power from which it exists...."
(Actualized-Potential)

Cusa gave his method a mathematical representation, but {not by the
formal, logical deductive procedures of Aristotle, or his later
followers, Euler, Lagrange, and the bigoted Cauchy}. In Cusa's
mathematical representation, what appears to be mathematically infinite,
that is, what is over, or beyond, the finite, (what Cantor would later
call the transfinite) indicates the existence of a new power or
principle acting on the domain of sense-perception from outside. Thus,
pushing finite mathematical expressions to the boundary, and beyond,
reveals the characteristics of those sought for, but yet undiscovered,
higher powers:

"...when we set out to investigate the Maximum metaphorically, we must
leap beyond simple likeness. For since all mathematicals are finite and
otherwise could not even be imagined: if we want to use finite things as
a way for ascending to the unqualifiedly Maximum, we must first consider
finite mathematical figures together with their characteristics and
relations. Next, we must apply these relations, in a transformed way, to
corresponding infinite mathematical figures. Thirdly, we must thereafter
in a still more highly transformed way, apply the relations of these
infinite figures to the simple Infinite, which is altogether independent
even of all figure. At this point our ignorance will be taught
incomprehensibly how we are to think more correctly and truly about the
Most High as we grope by means of a metaphor." (On Learned Ignorance,
Book I.)

Cusa elaborated this metaphor extensively. He examined carefully the
difference between the finite relations of the point, line, polygon and
circle, and their transfinite relations. In the finite, these objects
are each distinct, but transformed into their infinite forms, they
become congruent, indicating the existence of the higher principle from
which their finite relations are unfolded. Thus, the lower, finite forms
are bounded (and governed) by the higher, which, from the standpoint of
the lower, {appears} to be infinitely far away. Therefore, to know
anything about the relationships in the finite, one must view them from
the standpoint of the conditions at that seemingly infinite boundary. As
we will soon illustrate, this relationship reaches a more developed form
in Riemann's treatment of Abelian functions.

Like Plato, Cusa associated this capacity of the human mind, to reach
beyond the boundary of the apparent infinite, and identify new species
of numbers as powers, with the immortality of the soul:

"Likewise, the exhibiting of the mind's immortality can suitably be
pursued from a consideration of number. For since mind is a living
number, i.e., a number that numbers, and since every number is, in
itself, incorruptible (even though number seems variable when it is
considered in matter, which is variable), our mind's number cannot be
conceived to be corruptible. How, then, could the author of number
\[viz., mind\] seem to be corruptible? Moreover, no number can deplete
the mind's power of numbering. Hence, since the motion of the heavens is
numbered by the mind, and since time is the measure of motion, time will
not exhaust the mind's power. Rather, the mind's power will continue on
as the limit, measure, and determination of all things measurable. The
instruments for the motions of the heavens instruments produced by the
human mind attest to its not being the case that motion measures mind
rather than mind's measuring motion. Hence, mind seems to enfold by its
intellective operation all movement of succession, and mind brings forth
from itself rational operations, or rational movement. Thus, mind is the
form of moving. Hence, if when anything is dissolved, the dissolution
occurs by means of motion, then how could the form of moving be
dissolved through motion? Since mind is an intellectual life that moves
itself i.e., is a life that gives rise to the life which is its
understanding how would it fail to be always alive? How could
self-moving motion cease? For mind has life conjoined to it; through
this life it is always alive. (By way of illustration: a sphere is
always round, by virtue of the circle that is conjoined to it.) If
mind's composition is as the composition of number, which is composed of
itself, how would mind be dissolvable into not-mind?...

...thus, he who numbers unfolds and enfolds. Mind is an {image} of
Eternity, but time is an {unfolding} of Eternity..."(The Laymen on Mind)

Unlike the heathen Aristotle, for Cusa, the infinite is not outside the
universe. What appears to be infinitely far away from the standpoint of
sense-perception, is only the boundary marking the transition to the
unseen, but efficient, domain of universal physical principles. Those
principles reach through that boundary, into the visible domain,
determining the characteristics of action within it. The mind, in turn,
reaches back, transcending the apparently infinite, and discovering the
characteristics of those principles. {Thus, the appearance of the
infinite in mathematical expressions, simply indicates the necessity for
a transformation of the mind's idea a transformation that makes a
universal principle that had appeared to be inaccessible, known.}

The Physical Generation of Powers

From Cusa, the road to the discovery of those higher species of
transcendental powers that are the subject of Riemann's work, goes
through the investigations of Gauss and Abel who were provoked by:

--Kepler's discovery that the principle of universal gravitation
generated planetary orbits that were essentially elliptical, and;

--Leibniz's determination that these orbits reflected a universal
principle of physical least- action expressed by the catenary curve.

In rejecting the Aristotelean formalism of Ptolemy, Copernicus, and
Brahe, and basing his investigation only on physical considerations,
Kepler was compelled to reject the mathematically simpler circular
orbits for the physically determined elliptical ones. This produced a
crisis, because, whereas in a circular orbit, there is an
incommensurability between the angle and the sine, in an elliptical
orbit, there is an incommensurability between the arc and the angle as
well. Kepler's attempts to measure elliptical motion from the standpoint
of the circular functions (i.e., as the connected action of a
rectilinear triangle and a circular arc), produced the paradox known as
"The Kepler Problem". Kepler developed a method to approximate this
measurement for practical purposes but, for him, this was insufficient.
Kepler was not a pragmatist. Though practical solutions were vital to
his work, Kepler was insistent on knowing the principle as well. When
knowledge of that principle eluded him, Kepler demanded that future
geometers solve the problem, insuring that even his own death would not
end his quest.

While Kepler did not discover the higher principle of elliptical motion,
he indicated where to look. In his related work on optics, Kepler
proposed to look at the ellipse as merely one phase in a single function
that generated all the conic sections. He expressed this geometrically
through his famous projection that carried the circle into a hyperbola.
[(See Figure
1.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part54_files_part54figure01.gif)
The emergence of an apparently infinite boundary between the ellipse and
the hyperbola, within an otherwise continuous function, indicated the
direction in which this undiscovered principle could be found.

The appearance of the infinite boundary between the ellipse and the
hyperbola reflects, of course, the double cone construction of the conic
section. On one side of the "infinite", the circle, ellipse and
parabola, only the lower cone is cut by an intersecting plane. It is
when that plane touches the upper cone, that the hyperbola is formed.

Leibniz, through an application of his infinitesimal calculus, showed
that the curvature of the hanging chain can be expressed as the
arithmetic mean between two exponential curves. [(See Figure
3.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part54_files_part54figure03.gif)
These exponential curves do not exist in the perceptible domain of the
hanging chain. Nevertheless, they express a characteristic of the
{physical manifold} that is acting, from outside the domain of
sense-perception, on the chain, in every infinitesimal interval.

ones. [(See Figure

In connection with this investigation of the catenary, Leibniz coined
the term {"function"} to denote a specified transformation. So, for
example, the exponential function transforms arithmetic relations into
the geometric ones. Its inverse, the logarithmic function, transforms
geometric relations into arithmetic ones. As the arithmetic mean between
two exponential functions, the catenary, therefore, is a function of two
functions.

When Leibniz pushed this investigation to its boundary, by attempting to
determine the function that generates the logarithms of negative
numbers, he met the appearance of the square root of -1, which he
identified as existing in a real, but "imaginary" domain.

That Undiscovered Country

Thus, the young Gauss, confronted with the appearance of what Leibniz
called, "a fine and wonderful recourse to the divine spirit, almost an
amphibian somewhere between being and non-being", granted the square
roots of negative numbers their "full civil rights". From this
standpoint he reexamined the "Kepler Problem", and discovered that
elliptical motion was governed by a higher species of transcendental,
that had been anticipated by, but not known to Kepler or Leibniz.

The physical significance of complex numbers emerged quite naturally
from Leibniz's catenary principle and the paradox of negative
logarithms. [(See Figure
6.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part54_files_part54figure06.gif)

Since the catenary is formed as the arithmetic mean between {two}
exponential curves, Leibniz sought the function that generated both,
which could be expressed as that which generated their geometric mean.
But, there is no continuous transformation, within the plane of the
catenary, and the exponentials hanging behind it, that can transform one
exponential into the other. The only physical action that has the power
to produce both curves, is a rotation orthogonal to the plane of the
catenary. [(See Figure
7.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part54_files_part54figure07.gif)

If the direction of one exponential is designated as positive and the
other direction negative, the geometric mean between them is expressed
as the square root of a negative number. [(See Figure

This gives rise to the following paradox: In the plane of the two
exponentials, the geometric mean between them is a straight-line. But,
when looked at from the higher standpoint of physical action, that
straight-line is actually the axis of rotation from which is generated
an entire surface orthogonal to the plane of the chain. Thus, to
represent the physical action of the chain, the unseen exponentials that
hang behind it, and the unseen principle that generates the exponentials
themselves, requires both the plane of the chain, and the plane of the
action orthogonal to it.

Gauss conceived the idea of representing this complex domain on one
surface. That surface acts as a stage for the imagination on which
{both} the physical action and the universal principles that govern it
can be represented.

The two exponentials in the plane of the catenary are generated by an
action that is completely outside their visible domain. The point at
which the axis of rotation touches the surface generated by that
rotation, i.e. the center of the circle formed by that rotation, is the
only intersection between the visible domain and the surface on which
the principle of generation is represented.

Just as on the Classical stage, a single line, ("Its Greek to me.") in
the context of the drama, can indicate an historical transformation of
an entire culture, on the surface representing the complex domain, an
entire principle, in the context of a complex function, can be
represented by the action at a single point.

Hidden Harmonies Become Heard

By adopting Gauss's approach, Riemann was able to create a stage, on
which an innumerable class of transcendentals of successively higher
power could be brought within the scope of the imagination. Each new
species of transcendental, beginning with the simplest species of
transcendentals discovered by Cusa, to the elliptical functions of
Gauss, to those higher species discovered by Abel, is distinguished from
its predecessor by the addition of a new principle. Under Riemann's
idea, each new principle is represented by a change in the geometrical
characteristics, {the topology} of the surface.

Here Riemann adopted Leibniz's method of {analysis situs} as applied by
Gauss in his 1799 dissertation on the fundamental theorem of algebra.
Gauss showed that formal algebra could not distinguish the implications
of a change from one power to another. This is reflected, as Gauss
ironically emphasized, in the inability, from the standpoint of formal
algebra, to answer algebra's most important question: "How many
solutions are there for a given algebraic expression?" It was only when
these expressions were thought of geometrically, as surfaces, that their
essential characteristics could be made known. Then, it was clear, that
the highest power of the function determined a topological
characteristic (the number of "humps") that was independent of any
variations in the lower powers or the coefficients of that function.

Thus, Gauss's employment of Leibniz's geometry of position, {analysis
situs}, expressed the epistemological relationship that the principle
associated with the highest power dominated all lower ones. A change in
the degree of power is, therefore, a change in the governing principle,
and is expressed by a transformation of the entire geometry of the
surface. Thus, the essential characteristics of an entire species of
algebraic functions could be known completely, without the useless
formal calculations of Euler, Lagrange and D'Alembert.

To illustrate Riemann's approach, we begin with a look at the simplest
species of transcendental, those associated with the circular,
hyperbolic and exponential functions. As Leibniz and Bernoulli
demonstrated the catenary, expressing the universal physical principle
of least-action, embodied all three of these functions in one single
physical action.

However, from the standpoint of the "simple" domain, these three
functions seemed to have entirely different characteristics. For
example, the circle and the hyperbola are conic sections, the
exponential is not. In the visible domain, the circle is periodic, the
hyperbola and exponential appear infinitely extended.

Leibniz imagined that a higher principle united all three
transcendentals, but he never elaborated his idea. The sophisticated,
but Leibniz-hating Euler, tried to obscure Leibniz's insight with a
series of algebraic formalisms, (such as his infamous equations: e
^i\*Pi^ -1=0; and e ^i\*x^ =cos\[x\]+i\*sin\[x\]) which have bedeviled
generations of students and scientists to this day.

Yet through Gauss's and Riemann's physical conception of the complex
domain it can be easily demonstrated that these three functions express
one unified species of transcendentals, and are all derived from the
complex exponential. Gauss recognized this as early as August 14, 1796,
writing in his notebook: "By the way, (a+b\*?-1) ^m+n\*?-1^ has been
explained".

Here Gauss indicates he has extended the idea of the exponential
function to the complex domain. As noted above, the exponential function
is the transformation of arithmetic relationships into geometric ones.
In the "simple" domain, this appears geometrically as the characteristic
curvature of a single curve, as, for example, the equiangular spiral,
hyperbola or exponential curve. In Gauss's complex domain, the complex
exponential function transforms the arithmetic relations of an entire
surface into geometric ones, transforming all curves into new ones.

This can be seen most easily from the geometrical example in Gauss's
Copenhagen Prize Essay on conformal mapping (on which Riemann relied.).
There Gauss shows that the complex exponential function corresponds to
the stereographic projection of a sphere onto a plane a projection first
developed by the ancient Greeks in connection with the mapping of the
celestial sphere. [(See Figure
10.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part54_files_part54figure10.gif)

Under this projection, the circles of "latitude" on the sphere are
projected onto concentric circles on the plane, whose radii are
expanding exponentially. Circles of "longitude" on the sphere are
transformed into radial lines on the plane.

Don't think of this transformation as a static image. Think of it from
the standpoint of physical action. Think of the motion along a circle of
latitude on the sphere. What is the corresponding motion on the plane?
Think of the motion along a circle of longitude on the sphere. What is
the corresponding motion in the plane? Think of motion along a path of
equal heading on the sphere (loxodrome). What is the corresponding
motion along in the plane? When you think of it in this way, you can
begin to see how all relationships on the sphere are transformed,
lawfully, into different relationships on the plane.

Here a crucial new idea emerges that cannot be seen in the "simple"
domain. What appeared to be "infinitely" long radial lines of the plane,
become "finite" circles of longitude on the sphere. Action on the plane
that appears to go off into the "infinite" approaches a single point on
the sphere. From the standpoint of Cusa, if the terminus of all the
radial lines in the plane is thought of as the "infinite" circle, its
image is a single point on the sphere. In other words, the principle
bounding the action on the plane, that appears to be infinite and
unknowable, is brought into the imagination, by the action associated
with a single point on the sphere. Thus, in the complex domain, we can
faithfully represent Cusa's notion that in the infinite, the center and
circumference, minimum and maximum, coincide.

It is important to emphasize, however, that physical action, such as the
hanging chain, is never "infinite". The catenary is the curve of a chain
hanging between two positions. Thus, "this side of the infinite", the
physical exponential is always bounded. It is the universal principle
that it reflects that is {transfinite}.

Another characteristic now comes into view that otherwise remained
hidden with the "simple" view of the exponential. In the simple domain,
the exponential curve appears aperiodic But, this is only an illusion
caused by viewing the exponential too simply. As can be seen in the
image of the stereographic projection, the radial lines are unbounded,
but the circles of latitude are periodic. (As you can imagine, this
period is real. It is Euler's fraud to insist that the period of the
complex exponential is "imaginary".)

The hidden periodicity of the complex exponential can be seen more
dramatically when viewed as a transformation of an orthogonal grid of
curves on a plane, or, as Riemann suggested, on the surface of a very
large sphere. [(See Figure
11.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part54_files_part54figure11.gif)

Here all "straight" lines are transformed into a network of equiangular
spirals, bounded by spirals with maximum rotation and minimum extension
(i.e., circles), and spirals with maximum extension and minimum rotation
(i.e., radial lines).

Think of this image from the standpoint of action. Under the
transformation of the complex exponential, motion along a "straight"line
is transformed into spiral motion, including the extreme cases of the
circles and the radial lines. The non-periodic motion along the vertical
lines is transformed into periodic circular action. [(See Figure

The aperiodic motion along horizontal lines is transformed into motion
along the exponentially extending radii, which remains aperiodic. Motion
along a diagonal line is transformed into ever expanding spiral action.

Now compare this result with what was noted above concerning the two
exponential curves associated with the hanging chain. In the visible
domain, this action is aperiodic. However, the rotation orthogonal to
the plane of the hanging chain has a periodicity. Here we can recognize
the physical reality of the exponential function's "imaginary" period.

As Leibniz and Bernoulli demonstrated in their work on the catenary, the
hyperbolic functions are functions of the exponential: the hyperbolic
cosine is one-half the sum of two exponentials and the hyperbolic sine
is one-half the difference of two exponentials. (See [Figure
14.](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part54_files/part54figure14a.gif) )

As Leibniz also insisted, the circular functions are also functions of
the exponential, but only in a different, "imaginary", domain. [(See

The circular cosine is one-half the sum of two complex exponentials,
while the circular sine is one-half the difference of two complex
exponentials.

When viewed from the standpoint of Gauss's and Riemann's complex domain,
all these functions can be expressed by the same type of action: the
arithmetic mean between two complex exponentials moving in opposite
directions, as illustrated by the circles in the accompanying animation.

.) Together, the hyperbolic and circular functions form the four
different variations of the same type of action. Thus, generated by the
same type of action, they are all of the same species of transcendental.

The Elliptical Transcendentals

The young Gauss, contemplating the origin of the "Kepler Problem", was
puzzled by the inability to express elliptical motion by the circular,
hyperbolic or exponential functions. But, when he looked at a similar
problem, that of the lemniscate, from the standpoint of the complex
domain, he discovered a different species of transcendental that was
expressed by elliptical motion. When the characteristics of that species
are viewed on Riemann's stage, the difference between the elliptical and
the lower transcendentals becomes obvious.

While Gauss did not state it this way directly, his January 1797
decision to begin serious investigation of the lemnsicate alludes to the
clue suggested earlier by Kepler's concept of the conic sections.

As noted above, Kepler thought of all the conic sections as being
generated from one continuous function. The emergence of an infinite
boundary, between the ellipse and the hyperbola, reflects the transition
to the inclusion of the upper cone in the double conical function. Thus,
the entire function involves action in two different directions
(parallel and perpendicular to the base of the cones). When thought of
from the standpoint of Cusa, the appearance of the infinite signifies
that a higher, undiscovered principle exists that encompasses both the
perpendicular and parallel action as one. It is from this higher type of
function that Kepler's conic section function is unfolded.

This function must have the same relationship to the circular and
hyperbolic functions as those functions have to the algebraic. That is,
the higher species must have the capacity to generate the lower, but not
the inverse. This is akin to the relationship between the quadratic and
cubic species of magnitudes as viewed from the standpoint of Archytas.
The principle of toroidal motion that generates cubic magnitudes can
generate the quadratics as well, but not the inverse.

Now what is the nature of these elliptical transcendentals and how can
we discover it? Let's reconstruct Gauss's investigation of the
lemniscate from the standpoint of the clue supplied by Kepler, and the
later solution supplied by Riemann.

That the lemniscate would become the focus of Gauss's attention, flows
quite naturally from the extension of Kepler's concept of the conic
sections into the complex domain. As presented in previous installments
of this series, the lemniscate can be generated as the inversion of the
hyperbola in a circle, or the stereographic projection of a hyperbola
onto a sphere. (See [Figure
17](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part54_files_part54figure17.gif)
and [Figure
18](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part54_files_part54figure18.gif)
.) From the standpoint of these two projections, it can be seen that the
circle is the geometric mean between the hyperbola and the lemniscate.
Thus, we seek a higher function that transforms the hyperbola, through
the circle, into the lemnsicate.

It is important to take note of the method of inversion employed here.
In the case of the two exponential curves and the catenary, the
geometric mean between the two exponential curves could not be found
within the visible domain of the curves and the hanging chain. The
search for the principle that would generate both exponentials led us
into the complex domain. In the case of the conic sections, Kepler's
function generates one from the other. But the appearance of the
infinite in the middle of the function coaxes us to consider a higher
function. That function generates, not another conic section, but a
lemnsicate.

Now look at Kepler's function, as he envisioned it projected onto a
plane, and, from Riemann's standpoint, projected onto a sphere. [(See
Figure
19.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part54_files_part54figure19.gif)
In the former case, the circle is transformed into an ellipse, which is
transformed into an hyperbola, and then into a line. In the latter, the
circle is transformed into a projected ellipse, which is transformed
into a lemnsicate, and then into two coincidental hemispheric circles.

+:----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Thus, to grasp the higher principle we have to think of both functions
happening simultaneously: the one on the stage of the plane that is
generating the conic sections, and the one on the stage of the sphere,
that is generating a lemniscate. But from our vantage point we see both
on {one} stage the stage of the complex domain.

Note that the infinite boundary that appears in the plane, appears in
the spherical projection as the crossing point of the lemniscate. This
presence of the {transfinite}, represented as a single point in the
lemniscate, signifies the existence of an additional principle, that is
outside the domain of the conic sections, but, {inside} the domain in
which the lemnsicate resides. As noted in a previous installment, Gauss
showed that the crossing point on the lemniscate also reflects the
boundary between the regions of positive and negative curvature on the
torus. [(See Figure
20.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part54_files_part54figure20.gif)

Does the presence of this new principle indicate that the lemniscate is
associated with a different species of transcendental than the circular
or hyperbolic functions? Gauss said yes, and Riemann provided the basis
to recognize this geometrically.

Gauss recognized the existence of this added principle in the lemniscate
by the double periodicity of the lemnsicatic functions. Where, for
example, the circular functions are periodic with respect to the
interval 0 to 2Pi, the lemnsicatic functions are periodic with respect
to the interval 1 to -1 {and} the interval /-1 and -/-1. (See Riemann
for Anti-Dummies 52.)

Gauss expressed the geometrical characteristic of double periodicity in
his work on bi-quadratic residues, which he published in 1832. However,
its discovery was much earlier, as indicated by his notebook entry, "I
have discovered a remarkable connection between the lemniscate and
bi-quadratic residues".

That connection is illustrated by the geometrical representation Gauss
gave, with respect to simple and complex moduli, in his {Second Treatise
on Bi-Quadratic Residues}. There Gauss shows that for real numbers, the
modulus can be expressed geometrically by a simple line segment or
curve. (See [Figure

However, in the complex domain, a complex modulus is expressed by a
parallelogram on a surface. [(See Figure

This same geometrical distinction, as Gauss noted, also appears in
comparing the lemniscate with the circular functions in the complex
domain. In the case of the circular, hyperbolic or exponential
functions, motion in one direction was periodic, while motion
perpendicular to it was not. As illustrated above, this type of motion
could be mapped onto a surface such as a sphere.

However, for the lemnsicate, the motion is periodic in two directions
simultaneously. (See

Such motion can not be represented on Riemann's sphere, where one
direction, such as the circles of latitude, are periodic, but, in the
orthogonal direction, the circles of longitude, are not periodic without
crossing the infinite.

Riemann showed that the elliptical functions could only be expressed on
a surface that allowed for two distinct periodic curves. Such a surface
can be constructed, Riemann showed, by taking the parallelogram of
Gauss's complex modulus and connecting the opposite sides to each other,
forming a surface with the topology of a torus. [(See Figure

On a torus, there are two distinct curves, one that goes around the
outside, and one that goes through the hole. [(See Figure
25.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part54_files_part54figure25.gif)

Riemann emphasized that the torus is an entirely different type of
surface than a sphere. {And, there is no continuous function that can
transform a sphere into a torus, without the introduction of a new
principle. Once introduced, that new principle effects a complete
transformation of all relationships on that surface.}

Through this investigation into the distinction between the higher
species of elliptical transcendentals and the lower species, we are able
to recognize that the difference between these two species of
transcendentals reflects a fundamental change in the number of
principles acting through each species. As Abel showed, an entire class
of transcendentals can be constructed of successively higher power . In
Riemann's elaboration, the change from one species to the higher,
conforms to a transformation from a domain of "n" principles to a domain
of "n+1" principles. As in Archytas's construction for the doubling of
the cube, or Gauss's method of his 1799 dissertation on the fundamental
theorem of algebra, such transformations can be made intelligible on the
stage of the complex domain, as a discontinuous transformation in the
{topology} of that domain.

More importantly, however, armed with this new power to make
intelligible the generation of higher species of transcendentals, we can
now envision the transformation that must occur, in any domain when a
new principle is added. Thus, through the willful employment of the
mind's power of discovery, we can reach past the boundary of what seems
to be infinite, and bring new principles into our conscious possession.

And this brings us back to Theatetus, who, as a young boy, shows us
today, that an entire species can be known, completely without
calculation.
