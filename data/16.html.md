What's in a Moment?

We are now at the point in this series, where we can begin to dig
directly into that rich vein of knowledge revealed by Bernhard Riemann'
s development of complex functions. However, it is necessary, before
embarking on that leg of this journey, that you first contemplate this
short, but important, pedagogical exercise. Its relevance will become
increasingly apparent to you.

Take the case of a Keplerian orbit. At each moment the planet is
changing its speed and trajectory. That change is being guided by the
underlying hyper-geometry of the solar system, which has determined the
shape of the orbit. That hyper-geometry, thus, requires the planet to
change its speed and trajectory, at each moment, according to a
principle, derived from the characteristics of the hyper-geometry.
Kepler showed that the principle governing the change in speed and
trajectory was expressed by the way equal portions of the planet's
period corresponded to equal areas swept out.

Now, here's the paradox. In any interval of the orbit, no matter how
small, the planet is doing something different at the beginning of that
interval than at the end, with the exception of the maximum and minimum
intervals. The maximum interval is the entire orbit. There, (at least in
first approximation), at the beginning and end of this interval, the
planet is doing the same thing. (For example, if we consider this
interval to be from, say, perihelion to perihelion.) The minimum
interval is the moment of change. In that moment, the planet ceases to
do what it just did, and starts becoming what it will be. Paradoxically,
the beginning and end of each moment, like the entire orbit, are also
equal. However, the type of change the planet is undergoing at that
moment is determined by the entire orbit. Thus, the maximum interval and
the minimum interval coincide.

From the standpoint of Leibniz' calculus, the integral is the maximum as
seen from the minimum, while the differential, is the minimum as seen
from the maximum.

This concept was expressed by Nicholas of Cusa in "On Learned Ignorance"
Book II:

"In like manner, if you consider the matter carefully: rest is oneness
which enfolds motion, and motion is rest ordered serially. Hence, motion
is the unfolding of rest. In like manner, the present, or the now,
enfolds time. The past was the present, and the future will become the
present. Therefore, nothing except an ordered present is found in time.
Hence, the past and the future are the unfolding of the present. The
present is the enfolding of all present times; and the present times are
the unfolding, serially, of the present; and in the present times only
the present it found. Therefore, the present is one enfolding of all
times. Indeed the present is oneness. In like manner, identity is the
enfolding of difference; equality \[the enfolding\] of inequality; and
simplicity \[the enfolding\] of divisions, or distinctions.

"Therefore, there is one enfolding of all things. The enfolding of
substance, the enfolding of quality or of quantity, and so on, are not
distinct enfoldings. For there is not only one Maximum, with which the
Minimum coincides and in which enfolded difference is not opposed to
enfolding identity. Just as oneness precedes otherness, so also a point,
which is a perfection, \[precedes\] magnitude. For what is perfect
precedes whatever is imperfect. Thus, rest precedes motion, identity
precedes difference, equality \[precedes\] inequality, and so on
regarding the other perfections. These are convertible with Oneness,
which is Eternity itself (for there cannot be plurality of eternal
things). Therefore, God is the enfolding of all things in that all
things are in Him; and He is unfolding of all things in that He is in
all things."

However, not all "moments" are the same. In the case of a planetary
orbit, while at all moments the planet's speed and trajectory are
changing, there are two unique moments, in which that change is a
complete transformation, specifically, aphelion and perihelion. In the
former, the planet's action changes from slowing down to speeding up,
while in the latter, the action changes from speeding up to slowing
down. These two moments are called singular moments, or singularities.
The change at all other moments of the planet's action, is thus
determined by these two singularities, aphelion and perihelion.

As Kepler showed, these singularities are determined by a higher
principle of the hyper- geometry underlying the solar system. In other
words, that two singularities exist, is a characteristic of eccentric
orbits; that the orbit has this specific relationship to these
singularities, is a characteristic of the "more basic principle" , i.e.
the harmonic principle, that governs the whole solar system.

As we work through Riemann's discoveries in future pedagogicals, we will
present more examples of this same principle. For now, think back over
this one, so you get used to this way of thinking.
