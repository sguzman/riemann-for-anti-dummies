## Pythagoras as Riemann Knew him {#pythagoras-as-riemann-knew-him style="text-align: left;"}

There is a widely circulated report that when Pythagoras discovered the
incommensurability of the side of a square to its diagonal, he sought to
conceal its discovery on pain of death to whomever would disclose it.
But such an account is of dubious veracity, as it attributes to
Pythagoras an attitude more appropriate to his enemies than to his
collaborators. For it was the Eleatics, Sophists and Aristotle, who
insisted that what was inexpressible could not be known; and it was
Aristotle's Satanic disciples, as Bertrand Russell would come to
exemplify, who demanded physical death for those who posed the potential
for discovering new ideas; and it was Aristotle's method itself, when
practiced as directed, that caused so much mental disease from his day
to ours. For Aristotle: control what can be expressed, and you control
what can be known.

On the other hand, those who considered themselves Pythagoreans realized
that the inexpressible was the frontier, not the barrier, of human
thought. As Plato expressed it in the {Laws}, those who don't know the
significance of the incommensurability of the line with the square, and
the square with the cube, were closer to "guzzling swine" than human
beings. The issue for the Pythagoreans was not that the inexpressible
could not be known, but simply that it could not be expressed, in terms
consistent with an {a priori} set of axioms, postulates and definitions,
as Aristotle insisted. Thus, for the Pythagoreans, the discovery of
something inexpressible was not a cause for alarm, but a joyful occasion
to demonstrate, that man was not constrained by mere Aristotelean logic,
but was, unlike a swine, free and unbounded.

Therefore, as Plato insisted, it is of great benefit, and to be highly
recommended, that political leaders discover for themselves the
significance of incommensurability, in the terms that that discovery was
known to Pythagoras and Plato. However, the true profundity of that
discovery becomes much more fully illuminated when viewed from the
standpoint of its more advanced development--the complex domain of Gauss
and Riemann as that concept is expressed by Gauss's 1799 {New Proof of
the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra}, and Riemann's crucial 1854
Habilitation lecture, and his 1855-57 lectures and writings on
elliptical, Abelian and hypergeometric functions. These breakthroughs
show that the principles discovered by the Pythagoreans were simply the
first of an extended, and virtually unbounded, succession of
transcendental functions, that express the increasing power of the human
mind to discover, and communicate, ideas concerning universal physical
principles.

Knowing Is Not Calculating

Much to the disdain of the Leibniz-hating followers of Euler, Kant,
Lagrange and Cauchy, Riemann insisted that physical principles could be
known, and given a mathematical expression, "virtually without
calculation." In taking this approach, Riemann was directly in the
Pythagorean tradition of Plato, Cusa, Kepler and Leibniz, who all
recognized, that to know a physical principle, meant to have an {idea}
concerning that principle's generative power, the which could never be
discovered, nor expressed, by merely calculating that power's visible
effects. As Gauss noted in comparing Euler's attempt to determine the
orbit of a comet by calculation (an effort that left poor E. blind in
one eye), with his own uniquely successful determination of the orbit of
Ceres, "I too would have gone blind had I calculated like Euler!"

Gauss's comment was consistent with, and inspired by, Kepler's earlier
attack on the Aristotelean Petrus Ramus's diabolical demand that the
tenth book of Euclid, (which concerns the incommensurables) be banned.
Ramus insisted, as did Aristotle, that since only ratios of whole
numbers were susceptible to finite calculation, no physical action was
knowable, that could not be calculated thus. (Ironically, Gauss's,
{Disquisitiones Arithmeticae}, {Treatises on Biquadratic Residues I &
II} and the subsequent work of Lejeune Dirichlet and Riemann on the
subject of prime numbers show, that even the principles governing whole
numbers cannot be expressed by the linear arithmetic advocated by
Aristotle and Ramus.)

In his {Hamonices Mundi}, Kepler demonstrated that the physical
principles that govern planetary motion cannot be expressed by the
ratios of whole numbers, but only by those magnitudes which the
Aristoteleans considered "inexpressible", specifically the magnitudes
associated with the regular divisions of the circle, the five regular
spherical solids, and the harmonic relations of the musical tones.

This posed an ontological paradox for the Aristotelean. The principles
governing physical action were inexpressible in terms acceptable to the
Aristotelean. Therefore, as Aristotle's syllogism went, the physical
universe was unknowable.

But for Kepler, the principle governing physical action could be
{discovered}, by physical hypothesis, and {known} as a simple, i.e.
unified, idea ({Geistesmasse}) . The effect of that principle could be
expressed mathematically only by the appropriate, "inexpressible",
magnitudes. An inexpressible magnitude was thus known, not in itself,
but as that which was produced by the effect of a discovered physical
principle.

{In other words, the principle is not known by a magnitude. Magnitude is
known by the principle whose effect it expresses.}

Here, Kepler took his approach directly from Nicholas of Cusa, who,
citing the Pythagoreans in {The Laymen on Mind}, insisted that such
inexpressible magnitudes, such as the proportion of the side of a square
to its diagonal, or the relationships among the musical tones, lead to
an understanding of " a number that is simpler than our mind's reason
can grasp":

"By comparison then, see how it is that the infinite oneness of the
Exemplar can shine forth only in a suitable proportion a proportion that
is present in terms of number. For the Eternal Mind acts as does a
musician, who desires to make his conception, visible to the senses. The
musician takes a plurality of tones and brings them into a congruent
proportion of harmony, so that in that proportion the harmony shines
forth pleasingly and perfectly. For there the harmony is present as in
its own place, and the shining forth of the harmony is made to vary as a
result of the varying of the harmony's congruent proportion. And the
harmony ceases when the aptitude-for-proportion ceases."

John Keats makes clear in his great poem, {Ode on a Grecian Urn}, that
all human knowledge is gained in this way. Looking at the urn, Keats
sees the images of an ancient Greek society-- images of real people who
lived and died, with passions much like ours. Yet all the questions he
poses, which attempt to determine what the formalist would consider
precise knowledge of those people and their culture, go unanswered.
However, what is completely known, with absolute precision, is that
{principle} of whose effect this urn is an image--the eternal power of
human thought:

When old age shall this generation waste,\
Though shalt remain, in midst of other woe\
Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say'st,\
"Beauty is truth, truth Beauty" that is all\
Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.

**Toward an Extended Class of Higher Transcendentals**

To understand Riemann's essential discovery, we must take a quick look
back, at the early development of the knowledge of inexpressibles, from
the higher standpoint of Riemann's work.

Begin with the magnitude which doubles the line. It can double the line
but not a square. Yet, the magnitude that doubles the square is
inexpressible, in terms of the magnitude that doubles the line.
Inexpressible, but known--as that magnitude, that expresses the effect,
of the physical principle, that has the {power}, (i.e., {dynamis}), to
double a square. Thus, this simple, yet inexpressible magnitude, is
known.

The magnitude that doubles the square, however, cannot triple, nor
quadruple, nor quintuple, etc., a square. These magnitudes are
associated with different physical actions. Though each is distinct,
they are nevertheless mutually related, and expressed by the general
relationship, which the Pythagoreans called one geometric mean between
two extremes. Thus, each particular square power is generated by a still
higher species of power--the power that generates all individual square
powers.

This higher power can be given a clear mathematical expression as the
geometrical relationships among the sides of the connected right
triangles formed by a certain motion in a semi-circle. [(See Figure
1.)](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part57_files/part57figure01.gif) While
this construction expresses the effect of this power, as one unified
action, it is not the power itself. The power is in the {idea} of that
which has the power to generate all individual square powers. By giving
the effect of this idea such an expression, our {mind's} power to
control, and act on this {physical} power, is increased.

But to know more of this idea, we must know not only what it can do, but
what it cannot. This square power, while unlimited with respect to
squares, is impotent to double a cube. The doubling, tripling, etc. of
the volume of a cube, is the effect of a different species of power,
which the Pythagoreans understood could be expressed as two geometric
means between two extremes.

As Archytas's construction demonstrates, the generation of this cubic
power, can be given a mathematical expression by the proportions
generated by a series of connected right triangles formed by the
relative motion of two orthogonal semi-circles. [(See Figure
2.)](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part57_files/part57figure02.gif) The
relationships among the right triangles so produced, though changing,
always express two geometric means between two extremes.

This construction expresses not only the effect of the cubic power, but
also the connection between the cubic and the square power, because
here, the effect that generates the square powers, is itself generated
as an effect, of the motion that generates the cubic.

Even more importantly, the Archytas construction provides an insight, if
seen from the standpoint of Cusa, into that still higher power, from
which the square and cubic powers are themselves generated. While the
specific magnitudes that correspond to the edges of squares and cubes
are generated in the above construction as specific relationships among
the lines forming the sides of right triangles, those relationships are
determined not solely by lines, but by the connected effect of circular
and rectilinear action.

This can be seen clearly in the above cited figures. In figure 1, the
relationships among the sides of the triangle are formed as an effect of
the connection between the uniform motion of "P" along the circular arc
which generates the non-uniform motion of "Q" along a line. But in
figure 2, "Q" now moves both along a straight-line, {and} around a
circular arc, while the motion of "P" is along both a circular arc {and}
along the curve formed by the intersection of a torus and cylinder.

Thus, it is a type of doubly-connected circular action that generates
the rectilinear relationships that determine the effective changes in
squares and cubes. Cusa, in {On the Quadrature of the Circle}, became
the first to identify, and prove, that this circular action was an
effect of an entirely different species of power, than the cubic and
square powers. Leibniz identified this species of power as
{transcendental}, as distinct from the lower species of powers (such as
the cubic and square), which he called {algebraic}.

Power From the Standpoint of the Complex Domain

The above review is pedagogically helpful as a starting point for
approaching the work of Gauss and Riemann. As these simple examples
illustrate, physical processes are the effects of a connected action of
physical powers (principles). Each power is expressed by a distinct
species of magnitude. But, when a physical action is generated as the
effect of a connected action among a group of powers, it generates a
manifold, the which expresses a new, and completely different,
characteristic species of magnitude. Riemann called such manifolds,
"multiply-connected".

A strong word of caution is in order. As will become more clear as we
work through Riemann's ideas, by "multiply-connected", Riemann did not
mean the Aristotelean idea of a set of theorems connected to one another
through a lattice of logical formalism. Rather, Riemann's
multiply-connected manifold is a unity of demonstrable physical
principles, which, like Leibniz's {monads}, are distinct, but connected,
not directly to each other, as if point-wise, but only through the
higher organizing principle of the manifold itself.

A few physical examples, with which readers of this series will be
familiar, will help illustrate this point:

--As Kepler's principles of planetary motion illustrate, the planet's
motion, at every infinitesimal moment, is being determined by the
connected action of all those principles that govern action in the solar
system. This action is expressed mathematically by the combined effect
of Kepler's treatment of the five regular solids, the principles of
elliptical motion, and the harmonic relationship among the musical
pitches. As Gauss later showed through his determination of the orbit of
Ceres, and his later work on the secular perturbations of the planets
and asteroids, there are an even larger number of physical principles
affecting the motion of the planet at each moment, than those expressed
by Kepler. Gauss showed that the manifold of these connected principles
can only be expressed in the complex domain. (See pedagogical discussion
{Dance With the Planets.})

--The case of the intersection of a beam of light with a boundary
between two different media, such as air and water, in which some of the
beam is reflected and some of the beam is refracted. On the macroscopic
level, we can see that this action must be thought of as occurring in a
manifold that connects the two principles, reflection and refraction.
But as we take this investigation into the microscopic domain, many more
principles, those governing action in the atomic and sub-atomic domain,
come into play, requiring a re-conceptualization of the manifold, into
one with the power to connect a greater number of principles.

--The catenary's expression of the universal principle of least-action
as the arithmetic mean between two, oppositely directed exponentials.
Each exponential itself denotes a manifold that transcends all algebraic
powers. The catenary, therefore, must exist in a manifold that connects
two such transcendental manifolds. In this higher manifold, both
exponentials are acting, not only arithmetically, as indicated by their
visible relationship, but also geometrically, the latter acting in the
direction perpendicular to the visible plane of the hanging chain. [(See
Figure 3.)](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part57_files/part57figure03.gif)
As Gauss showed, a manifold with the power to act on both exponentials
arithmetically and geometrically, must be expressed as a surface in the
complex domain.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

In all of the above examples, the powers determining the physical
action, are acting, from outside the visible domain, but their effects
are present everywhere. Therefore, as Riemann made clear in his 1854
Habilitation lecture, to understand physical action, we must ban from
science all considerations of geometry formed from a set of {a priori}
axioms, postulates and definitions, and consider only {ideas} concerning
physical manifolds, whose "modes of determination" are physical
principles. With axiomatic assumptions now eliminated from geometry, the
characteristic of action associated with Euclidean geometry, i.e.,
infinitely extended linearity, in three directions, disappears as the
phantasm it always was. Instead, the characteristics of such a physical
manifold are determined only by the physical principles which form the
"modes of determination" of the physical action under consideration.

In his work, Riemann established the elementary principles to construct
an image that faithfully reflects the means by which such physical
"modes of determination" determine the characteristic of action in such
a multiply-connected manifold, by showing how the effect of these
principles determines the topology and characteristic curvature of the
image. Most importantly, what is gained by Riemann's method, is a means
to determine and express the type of change that occurs, by the
discovery of a new physical principle.

Riemann based his discovery on the previous work of Gauss, most notably,
Gauss's 1799 treatise on the fundamental theorem of algebra, and Gauss's
work on the general characteristics of curvature. Thus, it is most
efficient pedagogically, to begin with a quick review of these features
of Gauss's work.

In rejecting the methods of Euler, Lagrange, and D'Alembert, Gauss
showed that any formalist treatment of algebraic expressions, according
to the logical rules of algebra, lead to a contradiction, (i.e. the
square root of -1), within the domain of the formal system of algebra
itself. This was not the result, Gauss insisted, of some hidden flaw
within the logical system. It was a flaw of the system itself, arising
from the fact that the algebra of Euler, Lagrange and D'Alembert was
merely a logical system. As Gauss emphasized, the system could not be
reformed, it had to be abandoned all together. In other words, Gauss did
not come to save the system of algebra. He came to free science from its
mind-killing constraints.

As Gauss showed, the inherent flaw in the formalist's algebra, was the
treatment of an algebraic power by simple rules of arithmetic. Gauss, in
referring back to the Pythagorean principles of the doubling of the
line, square and cube, insisted that the "power" in an algebraic
expression must be understood to reflect a physical principle. For
example, an algebraic expression of the second degree, must concern what
Riemann would later call a "doubly- extended" relationship such as
areas; an expression of the third degree, must concern a "triply-
extended" relationship such as among volumes. A change from one power to
another, therefore, denoted a change in the number of principles under
investigation, not the number of times one number is multiplied by
another. By constructing his surfaces as images that reflect this
physical idea of power, the addition of a new power is reflected in the
image, as a change in what he called the geometry of position, or
topology, of the surface. [(See Figure
4.)](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part57_files/part57figure04.gif) Thus,
what is counted in algebra is not numbers, but powers. For Gauss, it was
mind deadening brainwashing to consider an algebraic expression as a set
of formal rules. Instead, he insisted, such expressions are, at best,
only a short-hand description of a physical action, whose real
characteristics could only be truthfully expressed through his geometric
constructions.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Riemann insisted that only a method similar to Gauss's could be applied
when investigating the transcendental, elliptical and Abelian functions.
As Leibniz had already indicated, such functions, by their very nature,
could never be expressed by any formal algebraic- type means. For
example, assigning a set of rules for calculating the expression "sine
of x" does not give us any knowledge of the transcendental relationship
between circular and rectilinear motion, let alone the profound
connection that Leibniz discovered between circular, hyperbolic and
exponential functions. Yet, as Leibniz emphasized, following Kepler and
Cusa, universal {physical }action could only be expressed by such
non-algebraic, "inexpressible" magnitudes.

Thus, for Riemann, to "know" a transcendental function, meant to know
its geometrical characteristics, because all attempts at formal
expression, as typified by the work of Euler, Lagrange, and the bigoted
Cauchy, were always impotent. (See The Dramatic Power of Abelian
Functions, Riemann for Anti-Dummies Part 54.)

In Riemann's geometrical expressions, as in Gauss's, the change from one
transcendental power to another, is reflected as a change in the
topology of the Riemann surface. For example, the circular/hyperbolic
transcendental, which is associated with the catenary, is simply
periodic, has two branch-points, and thus can be characterized by the
topology of the sphere. [(See Figure
5.)](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part57_files/part57figure05.gif)
Whereas the elliptical transcendental associated with the elliptical
orbit of a planet, or the motion of a pendulum, is doubly periodic, with
four branch-points, and is characterized by the topology of the torus. (
[See Figure
6](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part57_files/part57figure06.gif) . See
Riemann for Anti-Dummies 49, 52, 54, and 56 ).

Just as in the case of Gauss's treatment of algebraic powers, each
transcendental power is distinct. Consequently, the transition from one
transcendental to another, because it involves the addition of a new
principle, is not continuous. Like a discovery of a revolutionary new
idea, the shift to a new transcendental, suddenly and completely,
transforms all pre-existing relationships, that had been considered,
until then, fundamental.

For example, think of how Riemann expressed the effect of a simply
periodic transcendental function, through the image of a stereographic
projection of a sphere onto a plane. In this image, the circles of
latitude on the sphere are images of concentric circles in the plane,
and, as such, are orbicular. But, the circles of longitude are images of
radial lines which converge at the image of the "infinite", i.e., north
pole. Consequently, motion along these longitudinal circles can never be
periodic, as a complete rotation must always "cross over the infinite".

In this way, Riemann's image fixes in our mind the idea of a physical
process in which simple periodicity is a physical characteristic, not
simply a mathematical formalism.

On the other hand, a doubly periodic action is a connected action with
two distinct periods. Such an action could never be represented on a
sphere with an infinite boundary. As Riemann showed in his treatment of
the elliptical transcendentals, the type of surface on which these
elliptical transcendentals "live", must correspond topologically to a
torus, whose "hole" allows for these two distinct, but connected,
periods. However, as Riemann emphasized, the transformation from a
sphere to a torus is discontinuous, because an entirely new possibility
of action is added. In this way Riemann showed, that the essential
characteristics of a transcendental function, {and} the characteristic
of a change in transcendental power, could be made intelligible, even
though such characteristics were utterly "inexpressible" in formal
algebraic terms.

Riemann called the type of transformation just illustrated, a change in
the "connectivity" of the manifold. For Riemann, the sphere is
"simply-connected", because it has no hole and requires only one closed
curve to cut it into two distinct parts. The torus, on the other hand,
is a surface that Riemann called "doubly-connected", because it has one
hole and requires two closed curves to cut the surface into two distinct
parts. A "triply-connected" surface is one that has two holes, etc.

Riemann emphasized that connectivity is a characteristic, like the
number of "humps" in Gauss's surfaces, that is independent of all
measure relations of that surface, or calculations within the formal
expression. For example, in the case of an algebraic expression, it
doesn't matter how wildly the coefficients of the expression vary, the
physical characteristics of the action that expression describes are
determined solely by the number of principles involved, as denoted by
the expression's highest "power". This is what is reflected by the
topology (number of "humps) of the corresponding Gaussian surface. In
the case of Riemann's investigation of the higher transcendentals, the
"power" of the transcendental is expressed by a similar type of
invariant characteristic, the surface's connectivity.

It is important to note here, but reserve for the future its more
complete development, that Riemann showed that this characteristic
change in the topology of the image, is a function {solely} of the
"power" of the transcendental function, which, in turn, is determined by
the number of characteristic singularities generated by that
transcendental function. Thus, the "holes" in a Riemann surface do not
signify "nothingness", or that something is missing or left out. Rather
the number of holes signifies the density of singularities associated
with the power of the transcendental function.

In this way, Riemann showed, in his lectures on Abelian and
hypergeometric functions, that Abel's "extended class" of
transcendentals could be expressed by surfaces of increasing degrees of
connectivity, or what Riemann called "multiply-connected" surfaces. A
change in the number of singularities associated with a transcendental
function, is expressed as a change in the connectivity of the surface
that expresses that function.

Connectivity and Curvature

But, there is another significant characteristic of these higher
transcendental functions which Riemann emphasized, but which only comes
to light when Gauss's general principles of curvature are taken into
account. This can be introduced pedagogically by taking note of the
change in the characteristic curvature of the surface associated with
different transcendental functions. For example, a sphere, which is
simply-connected, is everywhere positively curved, but a torus, which is
doubly-connected, is positively curved only on the "outside", but
negatively curved on the "inside". (Ironically, and interestingly, this
combination of positive and negative curvature gives the torus a total
curvature of zero!) Thus, a higher transcendental power is associated
not only with a change in connectivity, corresponding to a change in the
density of singularities, but also with a change in the characteristic
curvature. Thus, a change in the power of a transcendental function ,
which occurs through the revolutionary discovery of an existing, but
previously undiscovered universal principle, changes the characteristic
curvature of the manifold of physical action.

To illustrate this, we must again turn back to the work of Gauss. In his
{General Investigations of Curved Surfaces}, Gauss showed that on a
positively curved surface the sum of the angles of a triangle is always
greater than two right angles (180 degrees), whereas on a surface that
is negatively curved, the sum of the angles of a triangle is always less
than two right angles. Inversely, the characteristic curvature of a
surface can be determined by the characteristics of the triangles that
exist on it.

Furthermore, this characteristic curvature of a surface determines what
Kepler called the types of congruences (harmonics) possible on that
surface. For example, on a surface of zero curvature, six equilateral
triangles can form a perfect congruence, because these triangles will
all have angles of 60 degrees, and six such angles form one complete
rotation. On the other hand, on a sphere, since any equilateral triangle
will always have angles that are greater than 60 degrees, three, four or
five triangles, but never six, will form a perfect congruence. Thus,
from Gauss's standpoint, the uniqueness of the five regular solida can
be demonstrated to be a consequence of the characteristic curvature of
spherical action.

But something very different happens on surfaces of negative curvature.
Since here the angles of an equilateral triangle are always less than 60
degrees, perfect congruences can be formed by any number of triangles
greater than six.

The problem Gauss understood, was that while surfaces of positive
curvature could be represented as objects in visible space, such as a
sphere, negative curvature acted on the visible domain from outside.
Consequently, no negatively curved surface could be faithfully
represented directly as a visible object! Gauss discovered, however,
that the relationships of negatively curved surfaces could be
represented visibly, but only as projections in the complex domain.
Although Gauss never published his results, his notebooks document the
direction of his thinking. [Figure
8](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part57_files/part57figure08.gif) shows
one of Gauss's drawings depicting the projection of a congruence formed
by eight triangles, each with three 45 degree angles. Such triangles
could only exist outside the visible domain, on a negatively curved
surface.

To understand this projection, think of it as an analogy to the
stereographic projection of the sphere onto the plane. In that case, the
circles of longitude are projected onto radial lines, and the circles of
latitude are projected onto concentric circles. [(See Figure
9.)](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part57_files/part57figure09.gif)

The circles of longitude are orthogonal to all circles of latitude, as
are the radial lines to the concentric circles in the plane. But,
whereas the circles of longitude all converge on the north pole, the
radial lines spread out, approaching Cusa's infinite circle. Note, that
these radial lines will, therefore, be orthogonal to the "infinite".
Spherical triangles on the sphere are projected onto the plane as
triangles whose sides are circular arcs, and whose angles are the same
as on the sphere. [(See Figure
10.)](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part57_files/part57figure10.gif)

But, though the angles are preserved by the stereographic projection,
distance is not. Consequently, as the distances measured approach the
north pole of the sphere, the distances in the image on the plane
increase exponentially.

Now look at Gauss's projection of a negatively curved surface. Instead
of an infinitely extended plane, the negatively curved surface projects
onto a bounded disc. Here the sides of the triangles are formed by
circular arcs, which, like the radial lines of the stereographic
projection, are orthogonal to the boundary of the surface. Also, as in
the stereographic projection, angles are preserved, but distances are
not. But unlike in the projection of a sphere, where the distances
become exponentially large as the boundary ("infinite") is approached,
the distances in the projected image of a negatively curved surface,
become exponentially shorter. [(See Figure
11.)](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part57_files/part57figure11.gif)

With this work of Gauss in mind, we can now begin to illustrate the
relationship Riemann showed, between the increasing density of
singularities associated with higher transcendental functions, and a
change in the characteristic curvature of the manifold.

This can be illustrated pedagogically by comparing the difference
between the elliptical transcendental and the hyper-elliptical. As
developed earlier, the elliptical transcendental, which generates four
singularities, is expressed as a Riemann function on a torus, on which
there are two distinctly different types of curves that go around the
torus and the curves that go "through the hole". [(See Figure
12.)](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part57_files/part57figure12.gif)

This doubly-connected action maps into a network of rectangles. ( [See
Figure 13](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part57_files/part57figure13.gif)
& Riemann for Anti-Dummies 56). As we just discovered through Gauss,
such a congruence of rectangles can only be formed on a surface of zero
or positive curvature.

But the next highest transcendental, the hyper-elliptical, generates six
singularities, and as Riemann showed, must be expressed on a
triply-connected surface, such as a torus with two holes. On such a
surface there are four distinct closed curves, instead of the two for
the torus. [(See Figure
14.)](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part57_files/part57figure14.gif) A
mapping of these four pathways yields an octagonal congruence. [(See

As Gauss showed, such a congruence can only exist on a surface of
negative curvature, and so its appearance in the case of the
hyper-elliptical transcendental is the image of a physical action,
characterized by negative curvature, acting from outside the visible
domain.

Thus, as we now think of the hierarchy of the so-called
"inexpressibles", from the algebraic, to the circular transcendentals,
to the elliptical transcendentals, to the hyper-elliptic and higher, we
can understand a successive transformation in curvature from zero
(rectilinear/algebraic), positive (spherical/exponential), to
positive/negative (elliptical/toroidal), to negative
(hyper-elliptical/Abelian).

Riemann emphasized that it is the relationship among these three
characteristic curvatures, positive, zero and negative, that
characterizes physical action. We cannot think of physical action as
being characterized by any one type of curvature, but must consider the
change in curvature that corresponds to the "power" governing the
action. In the Habilitation lecture, Riemann posed a pedagogical
construction of three such surfaces, represented by a sphere, cylinder,
and the inside of a torus, all intersecting at one circle. [(See Figure
16.)](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part57_files/part57figure16.gif) The
circle is the unique pathway that at all times exists on all three types
of curvature at once. Think of this circle as a new type of
"infinitesimal", a moment of change from one manifold to another of
greater transcendental "power".

This relationship between curvature and the higher transcendentals is of
extreme importance for the future development of modern physical
science. As Riemann stated in his Habilitation lecture, the
characteristics of physical action change when extended from the
observable range, into the astronomically large, such as the Crab Nebula
and the microscopically small, such as the sub-atomic domain. Such
changes correspond to an increasing density of universal principles,
i.e., singularities, which in turn is reflected as changes in the
characteristic curvature, and connectivity, of the manifold of physical
action.

As science extends its investigations into these domains, an ever
increasing number of universal physical principles will be discovered
and incorporated into our knowledge of the universe. Such increases are
associated with transcendental functions of increasingly higher power,
of the type suggested by Riemann a type whose power is akin to that
which connects us, through the mind of Keats, to those ancient people
depicted on that Grecian urn.

## Pythagoras as Riemann Knew him {#pythagoras-as-riemann-knew-him-1 style="text-align: left;"}

There is a widely circulated report that when Pythagoras discovered the
incommensurability of the side of a square to its diagonal, he sought to
conceal its discovery on pain of death to whomever would disclose it.
But such an account is of dubious veracity, as it attributes to
Pythagoras an attitude more appropriate to his enemies than to his
collaborators. For it was the Eleatics, Sophists and Aristotle, who
insisted that what was inexpressible could not be known; and it was
Aristotle's Satanic disciples, as Bertrand Russell would come to
exemplify, who demanded physical death for those who posed the potential
for discovering new ideas; and it was Aristotle's method itself, when
practiced as directed, that caused so much mental disease from his day
to ours. For Aristotle: control what can be expressed, and you control
what can be known.

On the other hand, those who considered themselves Pythagoreans realized
that the inexpressible was the frontier, not the barrier, of human
thought. As Plato expressed it in the {Laws}, those who don't know the
significance of the incommensurability of the line with the square, and
the square with the cube, were closer to "guzzling swine" than human
beings. The issue for the Pythagoreans was not that the inexpressible
could not be known, but simply that it could not be expressed, in terms
consistent with an {a priori} set of axioms, postulates and definitions,
as Aristotle insisted. Thus, for the Pythagoreans, the discovery of
something inexpressible was not a cause for alarm, but a joyful occasion
to demonstrate, that man was not constrained by mere Aristotelean logic,
but was, unlike a swine, free and unbounded.

Therefore, as Plato insisted, it is of great benefit, and to be highly
recommended, that political leaders discover for themselves the
significance of incommensurability, in the terms that that discovery was
known to Pythagoras and Plato. However, the true profundity of that
discovery becomes much more fully illuminated when viewed from the
standpoint of its more advanced development--the complex domain of Gauss
and Riemann as that concept is expressed by Gauss's 1799 {New Proof of
the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra}, and Riemann's crucial 1854
Habilitation lecture, and his 1855-57 lectures and writings on
elliptical, Abelian and hypergeometric functions. These breakthroughs
show that the principles discovered by the Pythagoreans were simply the
first of an extended, and virtually unbounded, succession of
transcendental functions, that express the increasing power of the human
mind to discover, and communicate, ideas concerning universal physical
principles.

Knowing Is Not Calculating

Much to the disdain of the Leibniz-hating followers of Euler, Kant,
Lagrange and Cauchy, Riemann insisted that physical principles could be
known, and given a mathematical expression, "virtually without
calculation." In taking this approach, Riemann was directly in the
Pythagorean tradition of Plato, Cusa, Kepler and Leibniz, who all
recognized, that to know a physical principle, meant to have an {idea}
concerning that principle's generative power, the which could never be
discovered, nor expressed, by merely calculating that power's visible
effects. As Gauss noted in comparing Euler's attempt to determine the
orbit of a comet by calculation (an effort that left poor E. blind in
one eye), with his own uniquely successful determination of the orbit of
Ceres, "I too would have gone blind had I calculated like Euler!"

Gauss's comment was consistent with, and inspired by, Kepler's earlier
attack on the Aristotelean Petrus Ramus's diabolical demand that the
tenth book of Euclid, (which concerns the incommensurables) be banned.
Ramus insisted, as did Aristotle, that since only ratios of whole
numbers were susceptible to finite calculation, no physical action was
knowable, that could not be calculated thus. (Ironically, Gauss's,
{Disquisitiones Arithmeticae}, {Treatises on Biquadratic Residues I &
II} and the subsequent work of Lejeune Dirichlet and Riemann on the
subject of prime numbers show, that even the principles governing whole
numbers cannot be expressed by the linear arithmetic advocated by
Aristotle and Ramus.)

In his {Hamonices Mundi}, Kepler demonstrated that the physical
principles that govern planetary motion cannot be expressed by the
ratios of whole numbers, but only by those magnitudes which the
Aristoteleans considered "inexpressible", specifically the magnitudes
associated with the regular divisions of the circle, the five regular
spherical solids, and the harmonic relations of the musical tones.

This posed an ontological paradox for the Aristotelean. The principles
governing physical action were inexpressible in terms acceptable to the
Aristotelean. Therefore, as Aristotle's syllogism went, the physical
universe was unknowable.

But for Kepler, the principle governing physical action could be
{discovered}, by physical hypothesis, and {known} as a simple, i.e.
unified, idea ({Geistesmasse}) . The effect of that principle could be
expressed mathematically only by the appropriate, "inexpressible",
magnitudes. An inexpressible magnitude was thus known, not in itself,
but as that which was produced by the effect of a discovered physical
principle.

{In other words, the principle is not known by a magnitude. Magnitude is
known by the principle whose effect it expresses.}

Here, Kepler took his approach directly from Nicholas of Cusa, who,
citing the Pythagoreans in {The Laymen on Mind}, insisted that such
inexpressible magnitudes, such as the proportion of the side of a square
to its diagonal, or the relationships among the musical tones, lead to
an understanding of " a number that is simpler than our mind's reason
can grasp":

"By comparison then, see how it is that the infinite oneness of the
Exemplar can shine forth only in a suitable proportion a proportion that
is present in terms of number. For the Eternal Mind acts as does a
musician, who desires to make his conception, visible to the senses. The
musician takes a plurality of tones and brings them into a congruent
proportion of harmony, so that in that proportion the harmony shines
forth pleasingly and perfectly. For there the harmony is present as in
its own place, and the shining forth of the harmony is made to vary as a
result of the varying of the harmony's congruent proportion. And the
harmony ceases when the aptitude-for-proportion ceases."

John Keats makes clear in his great poem, {Ode on a Grecian Urn}, that
all human knowledge is gained in this way. Looking at the urn, Keats
sees the images of an ancient Greek society-- images of real people who
lived and died, with passions much like ours. Yet all the questions he
poses, which attempt to determine what the formalist would consider
precise knowledge of those people and their culture, go unanswered.
However, what is completely known, with absolute precision, is that
{principle} of whose effect this urn is an image--the eternal power of
human thought:

When old age shall this generation waste,\
Though shalt remain, in midst of other woe\
Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say'st,\
"Beauty is truth, truth Beauty" that is all\
Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.

**Toward an Extended Class of Higher Transcendentals**

To understand Riemann's essential discovery, we must take a quick look
back, at the early development of the knowledge of inexpressibles, from
the higher standpoint of Riemann's work.

Begin with the magnitude which doubles the line. It can double the line
but not a square. Yet, the magnitude that doubles the square is
inexpressible, in terms of the magnitude that doubles the line.
Inexpressible, but known--as that magnitude, that expresses the effect,
of the physical principle, that has the {power}, (i.e., {dynamis}), to
double a square. Thus, this simple, yet inexpressible magnitude, is
known.

The magnitude that doubles the square, however, cannot triple, nor
quadruple, nor quintuple, etc., a square. These magnitudes are
associated with different physical actions. Though each is distinct,
they are nevertheless mutually related, and expressed by the general
relationship, which the Pythagoreans called one geometric mean between
two extremes. Thus, each particular square power is generated by a still
higher species of power--the power that generates all individual square
powers.

This higher power can be given a clear mathematical expression as the
geometrical relationships among the sides of the connected right
triangles formed by a certain motion in a semi-circle. [(See Figure
1.)](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part57_files/part57figure01.gif) While
this construction expresses the effect of this power, as one unified
action, it is not the power itself. The power is in the {idea} of that
which has the power to generate all individual square powers. By giving
the effect of this idea such an expression, our {mind's} power to
control, and act on this {physical} power, is increased.

But to know more of this idea, we must know not only what it can do, but
what it cannot. This square power, while unlimited with respect to
squares, is impotent to double a cube. The doubling, tripling, etc. of
the volume of a cube, is the effect of a different species of power,
which the Pythagoreans understood could be expressed as two geometric
means between two extremes.

As Archytas's construction demonstrates, the generation of this cubic
power, can be given a mathematical expression by the proportions
generated by a series of connected right triangles formed by the
relative motion of two orthogonal semi-circles. [(See Figure
2.)](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part57_files/part57figure02.gif) The
relationships among the right triangles so produced, though changing,
always express two geometric means between two extremes.

This construction expresses not only the effect of the cubic power, but
also the connection between the cubic and the square power, because
here, the effect that generates the square powers, is itself generated
as an effect, of the motion that generates the cubic.

Even more importantly, the Archytas construction provides an insight, if
seen from the standpoint of Cusa, into that still higher power, from
which the square and cubic powers are themselves generated. While the
specific magnitudes that correspond to the edges of squares and cubes
are generated in the above construction as specific relationships among
the lines forming the sides of right triangles, those relationships are
determined not solely by lines, but by the connected effect of circular
and rectilinear action.

This can be seen clearly in the above cited figures. In figure 1, the
relationships among the sides of the triangle are formed as an effect of
the connection between the uniform motion of "P" along the circular arc
which generates the non-uniform motion of "Q" along a line. But in
figure 2, "Q" now moves both along a straight-line, {and} around a
circular arc, while the motion of "P" is along both a circular arc {and}
along the curve formed by the intersection of a torus and cylinder.

Thus, it is a type of doubly-connected circular action that generates
the rectilinear relationships that determine the effective changes in
squares and cubes. Cusa, in {On the Quadrature of the Circle}, became
the first to identify, and prove, that this circular action was an
effect of an entirely different species of power, than the cubic and
square powers. Leibniz identified this species of power as
{transcendental}, as distinct from the lower species of powers (such as
the cubic and square), which he called {algebraic}.

Power From the Standpoint of the Complex Domain

The above review is pedagogically helpful as a starting point for
approaching the work of Gauss and Riemann. As these simple examples
illustrate, physical processes are the effects of a connected action of
physical powers (principles). Each power is expressed by a distinct
species of magnitude. But, when a physical action is generated as the
effect of a connected action among a group of powers, it generates a
manifold, the which expresses a new, and completely different,
characteristic species of magnitude. Riemann called such manifolds,
"multiply-connected".

A strong word of caution is in order. As will become more clear as we
work through Riemann's ideas, by "multiply-connected", Riemann did not
mean the Aristotelean idea of a set of theorems connected to one another
through a lattice of logical formalism. Rather, Riemann's
multiply-connected manifold is a unity of demonstrable physical
principles, which, like Leibniz's {monads}, are distinct, but connected,
not directly to each other, as if point-wise, but only through the
higher organizing principle of the manifold itself.

A few physical examples, with which readers of this series will be
familiar, will help illustrate this point:

--As Kepler's principles of planetary motion illustrate, the planet's
motion, at every infinitesimal moment, is being determined by the
connected action of all those principles that govern action in the solar
system. This action is expressed mathematically by the combined effect
of Kepler's treatment of the five regular solids, the principles of
elliptical motion, and the harmonic relationship among the musical
pitches. As Gauss later showed through his determination of the orbit of
Ceres, and his later work on the secular perturbations of the planets
and asteroids, there are an even larger number of physical principles
affecting the motion of the planet at each moment, than those expressed
by Kepler. Gauss showed that the manifold of these connected principles
can only be expressed in the complex domain. (See pedagogical discussion
{Dance With the Planets.})

--The case of the intersection of a beam of light with a boundary
between two different media, such as air and water, in which some of the
beam is reflected and some of the beam is refracted. On the macroscopic
level, we can see that this action must be thought of as occurring in a
manifold that connects the two principles, reflection and refraction.
But as we take this investigation into the microscopic domain, many more
principles, those governing action in the atomic and sub-atomic domain,
come into play, requiring a re-conceptualization of the manifold, into
one with the power to connect a greater number of principles.

--The catenary's expression of the universal principle of least-action
as the arithmetic mean between two, oppositely directed exponentials.
Each exponential itself denotes a manifold that transcends all algebraic
powers. The catenary, therefore, must exist in a manifold that connects
two such transcendental manifolds. In this higher manifold, both
exponentials are acting, not only arithmetically, as indicated by their
visible relationship, but also geometrically, the latter acting in the
direction perpendicular to the visible plane of the hanging chain. [(See
Figure 3.)](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part57_files/part57figure03.gif)
As Gauss showed, a manifold with the power to act on both exponentials
arithmetically and geometrically, must be expressed as a surface in the
complex domain.

In all of the above examples, the powers determining the physical
action, are acting, from outside the visible domain, but their effects
are present everywhere. Therefore, as Riemann made clear in his 1854
Habilitation lecture, to understand physical action, we must ban from
science all considerations of geometry formed from a set of {a priori}
axioms, postulates and definitions, and consider only {ideas} concerning
physical manifolds, whose "modes of determination" are physical
principles. With axiomatic assumptions now eliminated from geometry, the
characteristic of action associated with Euclidean geometry, i.e.,
infinitely extended linearity, in three directions, disappears as the
phantasm it always was. Instead, the characteristics of such a physical
manifold are determined only by the physical principles which form the
"modes of determination" of the physical action under consideration.

In his work, Riemann established the elementary principles to construct
an image that faithfully reflects the means by which such physical
"modes of determination" determine the characteristic of action in such
a multiply-connected manifold, by showing how the effect of these
principles determines the topology and characteristic curvature of the
image. Most importantly, what is gained by Riemann's method, is a means
to determine and express the type of change that occurs, by the
discovery of a new physical principle.

Riemann based his discovery on the previous work of Gauss, most notably,
Gauss's 1799 treatise on the fundamental theorem of algebra, and Gauss's
work on the general characteristics of curvature. Thus, it is most
efficient pedagogically, to begin with a quick review of these features
of Gauss's work.

In rejecting the methods of Euler, Lagrange, and D'Alembert, Gauss
showed that any formalist treatment of algebraic expressions, according
to the logical rules of algebra, lead to a contradiction, (i.e. the
square root of -1), within the domain of the formal system of algebra
itself. This was not the result, Gauss insisted, of some hidden flaw
within the logical system. It was a flaw of the system itself, arising
from the fact that the algebra of Euler, Lagrange and D'Alembert was
merely a logical system. As Gauss emphasized, the system could not be
reformed, it had to be abandoned all together. In other words, Gauss did
not come to save the system of algebra. He came to free science from its
mind-killing constraints.

As Gauss showed, the inherent flaw in the formalist's algebra, was the
treatment of an algebraic power by simple rules of arithmetic. Gauss, in
referring back to the Pythagorean principles of the doubling of the
line, square and cube, insisted that the "power" in an algebraic
expression must be understood to reflect a physical principle. For
example, an algebraic expression of the second degree, must concern what
Riemann would later call a "doubly- extended" relationship such as
areas; an expression of the third degree, must concern a "triply-
extended" relationship such as among volumes. A change from one power to
another, therefore, denoted a change in the number of principles under
investigation, not the number of times one number is multiplied by
another. By constructing his surfaces as images that reflect this
physical idea of power, the addition of a new power is reflected in the
image, as a change in what he called the geometry of position, or
topology, of the surface. [(See Figure
4.)](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part57_files/part57figure04.gif) Thus,
what is counted in algebra is not numbers, but powers. For Gauss, it was
mind deadening brainwashing to consider an algebraic expression as a set
of formal rules. Instead, he insisted, such expressions are, at best,
only a short-hand description of a physical action, whose real
characteristics could only be truthfully expressed through his geometric
constructions.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Riemann insisted that only a method similar to Gauss's could be applied
when investigating the transcendental, elliptical and Abelian functions.
As Leibniz had already indicated, such functions, by their very nature,
could never be expressed by any formal algebraic- type means. For
example, assigning a set of rules for calculating the expression "sine
of x" does not give us any knowledge of the transcendental relationship
between circular and rectilinear motion, let alone the profound
connection that Leibniz discovered between circular, hyperbolic and
exponential functions. Yet, as Leibniz emphasized, following Kepler and
Cusa, universal {physical }action could only be expressed by such
non-algebraic, "inexpressible" magnitudes.

Thus, for Riemann, to "know" a transcendental function, meant to know
its geometrical characteristics, because all attempts at formal
expression, as typified by the work of Euler, Lagrange, and the bigoted
Cauchy, were always impotent. (See The Dramatic Power of Abelian
Functions, Riemann for Anti-Dummies Part 54.)

In Riemann's geometrical expressions, as in Gauss's, the change from one
transcendental power to another, is reflected as a change in the
topology of the Riemann surface. For example, the circular/hyperbolic
transcendental, which is associated with the catenary, is simply
periodic, has two branch-points, and thus can be characterized by the
topology of the sphere. [(See Figure
5.)](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part57_files/part57figure05.gif)
Whereas the elliptical transcendental associated with the elliptical
orbit of a planet, or the motion of a pendulum, is doubly periodic, with
four branch-points, and is characterized by the topology of the torus. (
[See Figure
6](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part57_files/part57figure06.gif) . See
Riemann for Anti-Dummies 49, 52, 54, and 56 ).

Just as in the case of Gauss's treatment of algebraic powers, each
transcendental power is distinct. Consequently, the transition from one
transcendental to another, because it involves the addition of a new
principle, is not continuous. Like a discovery of a revolutionary new
idea, the shift to a new transcendental, suddenly and completely,
transforms all pre-existing relationships, that had been considered,
until then, fundamental.

For example, think of how Riemann expressed the effect of a simply
periodic transcendental function, through the image of a stereographic
projection of a sphere onto a plane. In this image, the circles of
latitude on the sphere are images of concentric circles in the plane,
and, as such, are orbicular. But, the circles of longitude are images of
radial lines which converge at the image of the "infinite", i.e., north
pole. Consequently, motion along these longitudinal circles can never be
periodic, as a complete rotation must always "cross over the infinite".

In this way, Riemann's image fixes in our mind the idea of a physical
process in which simple periodicity is a physical characteristic, not
simply a mathematical formalism.

On the other hand, a doubly periodic action is a connected action with
two distinct periods. Such an action could never be represented on a
sphere with an infinite boundary. As Riemann showed in his treatment of
the elliptical transcendentals, the type of surface on which these
elliptical transcendentals "live", must correspond topologically to a
torus, whose "hole" allows for these two distinct, but connected,
periods. However, as Riemann emphasized, the transformation from a
sphere to a torus is discontinuous, because an entirely new possibility
of action is added. In this way Riemann showed, that the essential
characteristics of a transcendental function, {and} the characteristic
of a change in transcendental power, could be made intelligible, even
though such characteristics were utterly "inexpressible" in formal
algebraic terms.

Riemann called the type of transformation just illustrated, a change in
the "connectivity" of the manifold. For Riemann, the sphere is
"simply-connected", because it has no hole and requires only one closed
curve to cut it into two distinct parts. The torus, on the other hand,
is a surface that Riemann called "doubly-connected", because it has one
hole and requires two closed curves to cut the surface into two distinct
parts. A "triply-connected" surface is one that has two holes, etc.

Riemann emphasized that connectivity is a characteristic, like the
number of "humps" in Gauss's surfaces, that is independent of all
measure relations of that surface, or calculations within the formal
expression. For example, in the case of an algebraic expression, it
doesn't matter how wildly the coefficients of the expression vary, the
physical characteristics of the action that expression describes are
determined solely by the number of principles involved, as denoted by
the expression's highest "power". This is what is reflected by the
topology (number of "humps) of the corresponding Gaussian surface. In
the case of Riemann's investigation of the higher transcendentals, the
"power" of the transcendental is expressed by a similar type of
invariant characteristic, the surface's connectivity.

It is important to note here, but reserve for the future its more
complete development, that Riemann showed that this characteristic
change in the topology of the image, is a function {solely} of the
"power" of the transcendental function, which, in turn, is determined by
the number of characteristic singularities generated by that
transcendental function. Thus, the "holes" in a Riemann surface do not
signify "nothingness", or that something is missing or left out. Rather
the number of holes signifies the density of singularities associated
with the power of the transcendental function.

In this way, Riemann showed, in his lectures on Abelian and
hypergeometric functions, that Abel's "extended class" of
transcendentals could be expressed by surfaces of increasing degrees of
connectivity, or what Riemann called "multiply-connected" surfaces. A
change in the number of singularities associated with a transcendental
function, is expressed as a change in the connectivity of the surface
that expresses that function.

Connectivity and Curvature

But, there is another significant characteristic of these higher
transcendental functions which Riemann emphasized, but which only comes
to light when Gauss's general principles of curvature are taken into
account. This can be introduced pedagogically by taking note of the
change in the characteristic curvature of the surface associated with
different transcendental functions. For example, a sphere, which is
simply-connected, is everywhere positively curved, but a torus, which is
doubly-connected, is positively curved only on the "outside", but
negatively curved on the "inside". (Ironically, and interestingly, this
combination of positive and negative curvature gives the torus a total
curvature of zero!) Thus, a higher transcendental power is associated
not only with a change in connectivity, corresponding to a change in the
density of singularities, but also with a change in the characteristic
curvature. Thus, a change in the power of a transcendental function ,
which occurs through the revolutionary discovery of an existing, but
previously undiscovered universal principle, changes the characteristic
curvature of the manifold of physical action.

To illustrate this, we must again turn back to the work of Gauss. In his
{General Investigations of Curved Surfaces}, Gauss showed that on a
positively curved surface the sum of the angles of a triangle is always
greater than two right angles (180 degrees), whereas on a surface that
is negatively curved, the sum of the angles of a triangle is always less
than two right angles. Inversely, the characteristic curvature of a
surface can be determined by the characteristics of the triangles that
exist on it.

Furthermore, this characteristic curvature of a surface determines what
Kepler called the types of congruences (harmonics) possible on that
surface. For example, on a surface of zero curvature, six equilateral
triangles can form a perfect congruence, because these triangles will
all have angles of 60 degrees, and six such angles form one complete
rotation. On the other hand, on a sphere, since any equilateral triangle
will always have angles that are greater than 60 degrees, three, four or
five triangles, but never six, will form a perfect congruence. Thus,
from Gauss's standpoint, the uniqueness of the five regular solida can
be demonstrated to be a consequence of the characteristic curvature of
spherical action.

But something very different happens on surfaces of negative curvature.
Since here the angles of an equilateral triangle are always less than 60
degrees, perfect congruences can be formed by any number of triangles
greater than six.

The problem Gauss understood, was that while surfaces of positive
curvature could be represented as objects in visible space, such as a
sphere, negative curvature acted on the visible domain from outside.
Consequently, no negatively curved surface could be faithfully
represented directly as a visible object! Gauss discovered, however,
that the relationships of negatively curved surfaces could be
represented visibly, but only as projections in the complex domain.
Although Gauss never published his results, his notebooks document the
direction of his thinking. [Figure
8](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part57_files/part57figure08.gif) shows
one of Gauss's drawings depicting the projection of a congruence formed
by eight triangles, each with three 45 degree angles. Such triangles
could only exist outside the visible domain, on a negatively curved
surface.

To understand this projection, think of it as an analogy to the
stereographic projection of the sphere onto the plane. In that case, the
circles of longitude are projected onto radial lines, and the circles of
latitude are projected onto concentric circles. [(See Figure
9.)](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part57_files/part57figure09.gif)

The circles of longitude are orthogonal to all circles of latitude, as
are the radial lines to the concentric circles in the plane. But,
whereas the circles of longitude all converge on the north pole, the
radial lines spread out, approaching Cusa's infinite circle. Note, that
these radial lines will, therefore, be orthogonal to the "infinite".
Spherical triangles on the sphere are projected onto the plane as
triangles whose sides are circular arcs, and whose angles are the same
as on the sphere. [(See Figure
10.)](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part57_files/part57figure10.gif)

But, though the angles are preserved by the stereographic projection,
distance is not. Consequently, as the distances measured approach the
north pole of the sphere, the distances in the image on the plane
increase exponentially.

Now look at Gauss's projection of a negatively curved surface. Instead
of an infinitely extended plane, the negatively curved surface projects
onto a bounded disc. Here the sides of the triangles are formed by
circular arcs, which, like the radial lines of the stereographic
projection, are orthogonal to the boundary of the surface. Also, as in
the stereographic projection, angles are preserved, but distances are
not. But unlike in the projection of a sphere, where the distances
become exponentially large as the boundary ("infinite") is approached,
the distances in the projected image of a negatively curved surface,
become exponentially shorter. [(See Figure
11.)](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part57_files/part57figure11.gif)

With this work of Gauss in mind, we can now begin to illustrate the
relationship Riemann showed, between the increasing density of
singularities associated with higher transcendental functions, and a
change in the characteristic curvature of the manifold.

This can be illustrated pedagogically by comparing the difference
between the elliptical transcendental and the hyper-elliptical. As
developed earlier, the elliptical transcendental, which generates four
singularities, is expressed as a Riemann function on a torus, on which
there are two distinctly different types of curves that go around the
torus and the curves that go "through the hole". [(See Figure
12.)](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part57_files/part57figure12.gif)

This doubly-connected action maps into a network of rectangles. ( [See
Figure 13](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part57_files/part57figure13.gif)
& Riemann for Anti-Dummies 56). As we just discovered through Gauss,
such a congruence of rectangles can only be formed on a surface of zero
or positive curvature.

But the next highest transcendental, the hyper-elliptical, generates six
singularities, and as Riemann showed, must be expressed on a
triply-connected surface, such as a torus with two holes. On such a
surface there are four distinct closed curves, instead of the two for
the torus. [(See Figure
14.)](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part57_files/part57figure14.gif) A
mapping of these four pathways yields an octagonal congruence. [(See

As Gauss showed, such a congruence can only exist on a surface of
negative curvature, and so its appearance in the case of the
hyper-elliptical transcendental is the image of a physical action,
characterized by negative curvature, acting from outside the visible
domain.

Thus, as we now think of the hierarchy of the so-called
"inexpressibles", from the algebraic, to the circular transcendentals,
to the elliptical transcendentals, to the hyper-elliptic and higher, we
can understand a successive transformation in curvature from zero
(rectilinear/algebraic), positive (spherical/exponential), to
positive/negative (elliptical/toroidal), to negative
(hyper-elliptical/Abelian).

Riemann emphasized that it is the relationship among these three
characteristic curvatures, positive, zero and negative, that
characterizes physical action. We cannot think of physical action as
being characterized by any one type of curvature, but must consider the
change in curvature that corresponds to the "power" governing the
action. In the Habilitation lecture, Riemann posed a pedagogical
construction of three such surfaces, represented by a sphere, cylinder,
and the inside of a torus, all intersecting at one circle. [(See Figure
16.)](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part57_files/part57figure16.gif) The
circle is the unique pathway that at all times exists on all three types
of curvature at once. Think of this circle as a new type of
"infinitesimal", a moment of change from one manifold to another of
greater transcendental "power".

This relationship between curvature and the higher transcendentals is of
extreme importance for the future development of modern physical
science. As Riemann stated in his Habilitation lecture, the
characteristics of physical action change when extended from the
observable range, into the astronomically large, such as the Crab Nebula
and the microscopically small, such as the sub-atomic domain. Such
changes correspond to an increasing density of universal principles,
i.e., singularities, which in turn is reflected as changes in the
characteristic curvature, and connectivity, of the manifold of physical
action.

As science extends its investigations into these domains, an ever
increasing number of universal physical principles will be discovered
and incorporated into our knowledge of the universe. Such increases are
associated with transcendental functions of increasingly higher power,
of the type suggested by Riemann a type whose power is akin to that
which connects us, through the mind of Keats, to those ancient people
depicted on that Grecian urn.
