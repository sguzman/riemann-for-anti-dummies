Riemann for Anti-Dummies Part 49

THE HIDDEN HISTORY OF THE COMPLEX DOMAIN

When Kepler discovered the elliptical nature of the planetary orbits, he
uncovered a paradox whose solution would require the development of an
entirely new way of thinking, and he called on future generations to
develop it. This "Kepler Problem", as it has since become known, was not
merely a mathematical lacuna, but reflected the ontological paradox
indicated by Nicholas of Cusa in "On Learned Ignorance" and other
locations. Kepler's demand provoked Leibniz to develop the infinitesimal
calculus, which revealed a new manifestation of that same paradox. This
led Leibniz to indicate that the solution existed in a higher, yet to be
discovered, domain of the imagination. Reflecting on these developments,
the young Carl F. Gauss discovered that what both Kepler and Leibniz had
sought. He called it the complex domain.

The above sketch is the true history of the origin of the discovery of
the complex domain. It was known to Gauss's immediate collaborators and
followers, but today it lies hidden, even to the relatively best
scientific thinkers. What has been substituted is the myth that complex
numbers arise as "impossible" solutions to formal algebraic equations a
myth whose malignancy has infected today's popular thinking far beyond
the domain of pure mathematics. The source of the myth is not new, but
begins with Venice's Paolo Sarpi's launching of modern empiricism, and
continues as a progression of degeneration through Hobbes, Descartes,
Newton, Euler, Kant, Lagrange, Hegel, Cauchy, Klein, and down into the
modern forms of existentialism and information theory associated with
Synarchism. Today, as always, its target is the intellectual and
emotional powers of mind associated with the development of the nation
state, as embodied in the hard won Declaration of Independence and
Constitution of the United States.

Consequently, anyone wishing to know the principles of science, must
understand the connection between the history of the development of the
complex domain, and the fight for the founding and preservation of the
United States. Conversely, anyone wishing to know the latter, must
understand its connection to the discovery of the complex domain.

For this reason, it is crucial that the record be set straight.

What follows is a summary overview. An opening statement, so to speak,
designed to lay out what the investigation will show. It is best worked
through slowly in small discussion groups. Over the coming installments
of this series, we will explore these matters more deeply. This will
take us, albeit not without a certain amount of hard work, directly to
Riemann's investigation of the higher transcendentals which he called
Abelian functions.

The "Kepler Problem"

The ultimate source of Kepler's discovery of the planetary orbits lies
not in some particular astronomical theorem, but, as Kepler repeatedly
emphasized, in his conception of Man. Unlike Ptolemy, Copernicus, and
Tycho Brahe, Kepler understood that Man was distinguished from lower
forms of life, by the capacity of mind that enabled him to rise above
the limitations of sense-perception and discover those unsensed
principles that govern the universe. As such, Kepler rejected the
Aristotelean methods of Ptolemy, Copernicus and Brahe, all of which
sought only to model the appearances of the motion of the heavenly
bodies. Instead, as Kepler emphasized, his approach was to derive the
apparent motion of the planets as a function of their physical causes.
Consequently, where Ptolemy, Copernicus, and Brahe looked only to the
domain of sense-perception, Kepler looked to the interaction between
what is perceived and the principles that efficiently control what is
perceived.

This latter point is crucial. Kepler did not ignore the world of
sense-perception. Rather, he understood that what appeared to the senses
was caused by principles that were unseen. But since those principles
could not be sensed directly, they could only be known through
contradictions and paradoxes that emerge in the domain of the senses.
From these paradoxes, the mind has the power to form a synthetic
visualization, so to speak, through which it can grasp for itself and
communicate to other minds, those unseen principles indicated through
the paradox. This synthetic visualization is emphatically not a
symbolism. Rather it is a metaphor that preserves the paradox so as to
guide the mind to the indicated principle that lies behind it.

It is in this light that the "Kepler Problem" must be seen. This problem
arises when trying to determine the non-uniform motion of a planet. Cusa
had already indicated that motion in the physical universe did not
conform, as Aristotle had insisted, to fixed perfect circles. Instead,
Cusa indicated that the perfection of the universe were better expressed
by the principle of change, and, as such, action in the physical
universe must be non-uniform, i.e., changing.

By deriving motion of the planets from physical causes, Kepler was led
to the discovery that Cusa was right. Kepler demonstrated that the
non-uniform motion of the planet through its orbit, as measured by the
speeding up or slowing down of the observed movement of the planet
against the background of stars on the inside of the celestial sphere,
was not just an appearance, as Ptolemy, Copernicus and Brahe all held,
but actually reflected the true physical motion of the planet. Thus, the
planet didn't just appear to be always changing, it {is} always
changing. Consequently, the planet's motion was being governed, not by a
fixed principle such as would be characterized by perfect circles, but
by a principle of change.

Kepler showed that that principle of change was embodied in the Sun,
which had the power to move the planets by an immaterial "species"
(idea), just as an idea in the mind moves the body. The measured
speeding up and slowing down of the planet indicated the existence of an
elliptical orbit in which the planet's distance to the Sun is always
increasing or decreasing. The always changing speed and direction of the
planet, thus reflects the principle of change inherent in the principle
of universal gravitation, as that principle was understood by Kepler,
not the dumbed down bastardization associated with Newton.

However, the elliptical orbit presented a new type of paradox. As Kepler
stated it, the relationship between the planet's position and the time
elapsed could be measured by his famous principle of equal areas. But
these areas were measured by the combination of a circular sector and a
rectilinear triangle. [(See Figure
1.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure01.gif)
Because of the "heterogeneity" of these two areas, this relationship
could only be determined retrospectively: that is, if one knew where the
planet had been, it was possible to measure the portion of the planet's
total period that had elapsed during that interval. However, Kepler
said, there was no elegant way to determine, prospectively, where the
planet would be, in a specified interval of time.

"But given the mean anomaly (time elapsed-bmd), there is no geometrical
method of proceeding to the equated, that is, eccentric anomaly
(position bmd). For the mean anomaly is composed of two areas, a sector
and a triangle. And while the former is numbered by the arc of the
eccentric, the latter is numbered by the sine of that arc multiplied by
the value of the maximum triangle, omitting the last digits And the
ratios between the arcs and their sines are infinite in number. So, when
we begin with the sum of the two, we cannot say how great the arc is,
and how great its sine, corresponding to this sum, unless we are
previously to investigate the area resulting from a given arc; that is,
unless you were to have constructed tables to have worked from them
subsequently.

"This is my opinion. Insofar as it is seen to lack geometrical beauty, I
exhort the geometers to solve me this problem:

Given the area of a part of a semicircle and a point on the diameter, to
find the arc and the angle at that point, the sides of which angle and
which arc, encloses the given area. Or, to cut the area of a semicircle
in a given ratio from any given point on the diameter.

It is enough for me to believe that I could not solve this a priori,
owing to the heterogeneity of the arc to the sine. Anyone who shows me
my error and points the way will be for me the great Apollonius."

Thus, having rejected Aristotle's perfect circles, Kepler had to measure
the planet's motion not merely by the arc of a circle, but by the
relationship of that arc to its sine. However, as Cusa had indicated,
the ratio of the sine to the arc is "infinite". Thus, the physical
motion of the planet depended on a quantity whose characteristics could
be precisely known, but could not be precisely calculated. The ellipse
was not the orbit, it was that which is lawfully produced by the
principle of universal gravitation.

Kepler did not directly observe this elliptical orbit, and to this day
neither has anyone else. Nevertheless, the elliptical orbit was known to
Kepler (and is known to anyone who relives his thoughts), more surely
than if it had been directly seen. However, there is something more to
the planet's orbit. The ellipse is only the visible manifestation of the
principle of universal gravitation, produced by the always changing
action of gravitation on the planet at every moment of its motion.

The question posed by the paradox of the "Kepler Problem" is: what is
the hidden characteristic of universal gravitation that produces the
elliptical shape of the orbit?

Since that characteristic cannot be seen, it must be discovered through
the paradox it presents in its visible expression. That paradox is the
indeterminacy expressed by the "Kepler Problem". The paradox does not
exist for the planet. The planet "knows" at all times what it is doing.
It moves seamlessly; always changing. The paradox exists in the
expression of that continuously changing orbit within the visible domain
of the elliptical orbit, through, as Kepler expresses it, the infinite
ratio of the sine to the arc.

**Leibniz' Infinitesimal Calculus**

What was required to solve this paradox was a new type of geometry that
could express the relationship between the seen and the unseen. That is
what Kepler demanded, and that is what Leibniz supplied.

Working from Fermat's method of inverse tangents and maximum and
minimum, Pascal's investigations of conic sections, and Huyghen's
development of involutes and evolutes, Leibniz invented the
infinitesimal calculus as a new type of geometry that expressed not only
what was seen, but the relationship of what is seen to the principles
that lay behind it. For reasons that will become clear below, Leibniz'
calculus, though inspired to solve the "Kepler Problem", didn't provide
its solution. Such a solution would require Gauss' discovery of the
complex domain.

The most direct means of grasping the principles of Leibniz' calculus is
through his, and Johann Bernoulli's application of the calculus to the
solution to the catenary problem. As has been developed more thoroughly
in other locations, the catenary expresses a principle of universal
least-action. That principle is what produces the unique shape of the
catenary, which, like the planetary orbit, acts on the hanging chain
differently at each point. But unlike the planetary orbit, the catenary
does not conform to a conic section.

To determine the shape of the catenary, Leibniz and Bernoulli first
investigated the physical manifestation of this continuously changing
least-action. This is most easily demonstrated pedagogically by the
often cited experiment showing the physical determination of the
catenary curve using a string and a hanging weight. (See Riemann for
Anti-Dummies 46.) As Bernoulli showed in his treatise on the integral
calculus, the total effect of the principle of least action is expressed
by the general shape of the catenary, while its continuously changing
manifestation at each (infinitesimal) point along the chain, is
expressed by the relationship between the sines of the angles formed by
the tangents. [(See Figure
2.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure01.gif)
In other words, the principle of least action exists outside the
catenary, but "touches" it at every point as if it were acting tangent
to the curve. Consequently, the continuously changing relationship of
these tangents produces a visible expression of the everywhere present,
but non-visible, principle of least action.

As this crucial example of the catenary illustrates, the infinitesimal
calculus is not the geometry of the domain of sense-perception. It is
the geometry of the interaction between the domain of sense-perception
and the principles that lie behind it. It is a generalization of
Kepler's method of measuring the planet's motion in any given interval,
by its relationship to the whole orbit. It is in that relationship, of
the whole (integral) to the part (differential) that expresses the
interaction of the unseen to the seen. That which is seen is produced by
the unseen acting according to a discoverable principle at each
infinitesimal interval.

As mentioned above, Bernoulli's application of the calculus to the
catenary problem demonstrated that, like the planetary orbit, the
physical principle governing the catenary was dependent on the sine of
the angle. But, Leibniz further demonstrated that the catenary curve was
also determined by another type of relationship that he called
logarithmic. [(See Figure
3.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure03.gif)

As has been developed more fully in earlier installments, this
logarithmic relationship is the generalization of the principle of
higher powers that was developed by the Pythagorean- Socratic current in
Classical Greece, as typified by the investigations into the doubling of
the line, square and cube. As Plato emphasizes, each type of action is
associated with a magnitude of a different power, which are each
mutually incommensurable. The more general form of these types of powers
is expressed by the logarithmic spiral and the exponential function.
Provoked by the type of discovery expressed by the catenary, Leibniz
investigated this more general form of these "Platonic" powers, and
discovered that they were related to a still higher power, expressed
through the form of the so-called "natural logarithm".

This type of discovery led Leibniz to distinguish between two types of
magnitudes transcendental and algebraic. The algebraic are those types
of magnitudes exemplified by the powers that double the line, square and
cube. The transcendental are those types of magnitudes exemplified by
the trigonometric and the exponential functions. As Cusa had insisted,
the transcendental powers are a higher type. All algebraic magnitudes
can be generated from transcendentals, but not the inverse.

As mentioned above, the planetary orbit, while dependent on a
transcendental function, i.e., the sine, is expressed by a conic
section, i.e., an ellipse. Apollonius had already demonstrated, as was
later expanded by Fermat and Pascal, that the conic sections expressed
the relationship of the second (square) algebraic power.

As such, Leibniz distinguished between those types of curves, such as
conic sections, that could be expressed algebraically, and those, like
the catenary, that could only be expressed by transcendental functions.

The catenary in particular, however, expressed a relationship between
the two types of transcendentals. On the one side, as Bernoulli showed,
it expressed the trigonometric, whereas on the other side, Leibniz
showed it expressed the exponential. Thus, the physical principle of
universal least-action indicated a connection between these two types of
transcendentals. Yet, mathematically these two types of transcendentals
appeared to be generated differently.

It is in the investigation of the connection between these two types of
transcendentals that Leibniz encountered the square root of minus 1. He
expressed this as the paradox of logarithms of negative numbers. (See
Riemann for Anti-Dummies Part 38.) He insisted that these logarithms
existed, but not in the visible domain, but in a domain still to be
imagined. As he discussed the matter in a letter to Huygens, "... there
is almost nothing more to be desired for the use which algebra can or
will be able to have in mechanics and in practice. It is believable that
this was the aim of the geometry of the ancients (at least that of
Apollonius) and the purpose of loci that he had introduced.... "

He was convinced that the square roots of negative numbers provided the
paradox that would open the door to this new domain where the
interaction between the seen and the unseen could be expressed. He
referred to them, as "amphibians somewhere between being and non-
being".

Gauss, The Kepler Problem, and The Complex Domain

It was left to the young Gauss, when he was between the ages of
seventeen and twenty, to discover that the higher transcendentals to
which Leibniz had pointed, demand the development of the complex domain
as that thought-object through which the interaction between the seen
and the unseen could be expressed. Herein would emerge the source of the
"Kepler Problem" that the motion of the planets in elliptical orbits are
governed not by the circular transcendentals, but by a higher form of
"elliptical" transcendental, the characteristics of which could only be
discovered and expressed in the complex domain.

Gauss never published his findings, except to indicate in a famous
remark in the "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae", that his method for the
division of the circle could also be applied to other transcendentals,
particularly the lemniscate. Gauss promised to publish these results in
a future time. But, due to the oppressive conditions brought on by the
rise of Napoleon and its aftermath, Gauss never brought forth the
promised text. His remark, however, prompted two brilliant youth, the
Norwegian, Niels Henrik Abel, and the German, C. G. Jacobi, (both of
whom were students of Gauss's collaborators, Hansteen and Dirichlet ,
respectively) to independently develop these results. Upon seeing their
work, Gauss remarked that he had already developed this theory when he
was a youth. At the time, these comments were dismissed as arrogant
boasting by those in the scientific community who were submitting to
fascist terror, as exemplified by the supreme bigot, Augustin Cauchy.

Nevertheless, Jacobi believed Gauss was right, writing in Crelle's
Journal in May 1839, that it was the investigation of elliptical
transcendentals which led Gauss to introduce complex numbers . Yet, it
wasn't until 1898, when Gauss' youthful diaries became available, that
the truthfulness of Gauss's statements was fully confirmed.

From a review of these diaries, it is clear that from the beginning,
Gauss was engaged in one unified investigation: the development of the
complex domain as that idea necessary to express those higher
transcendental relationships governing the physical universe.

While popular academia grudgingly admitts today that Gauss was the
actual discoverer of elliptical functions, they still falsely present
this discovery as an extension of the formal algebraic approach of Euler
and Lagrange. While Gauss' 1799 dissertation already exposes this as a
lie, the diaries give an even more complete picture of Gauss' train of
thought.

The diaries begin on March 30, 1796, with the announcement of the
discovery that the 17-gon is constructible by straight-edge and compass.
As has been developed in other locations (Riemann for Anti Dummies Parts
30 and 31 and JBT's lecture on the heptadecagon in L.A.) Gauss'
discovery depends on recognizing that the visible circle is an artifact
of a process that can only be expressed in the complex domain. From the
standpoint of the visible domain, it appears that the circle can only be
divided into 2, 3, or 5 parts by straight-edge and compass, as was
believed for more than two thousand years. Yet Gauss showed that the
principle on which the division of the circle depends, can only be
expressed in the complex domain. From this standpoint, the division of
the circle is seen as the more general form of the ancient Greek
problems of doubling the square and the cube.

The doubling of the square and cube are determined by those principles
that generate one or two means, respectively, between two extremes.
Gauss showed, that from the standpoint of the complex domain, the
division of the circle into "n" parts is the problem of finding the
principle that generates "n-1" means between two extremes. If "n-1" is 2
to a power of 2, then the problem can be transformed into a succession
of square roots, and is susceptible of being constructed by straight
edge and compass.

Work through Gauss' method for dividing the circle for yourself, using
the above cited pedagogicals as guide. For this discussion, bear in mind
this crucial point. An action that is carried out in the visible domain,
dividing a circle into "n" parts, is determined by a set of
relationships that cannot be expressed in the visible domain. Rather,
those relationships can only be expressed in the complex domain, where
the interaction between the visible and the principles that lie behind
it, can be made manifest.

Is the complex domain real? You can actually, with straight-edge and
compass, divide a visible circle into 17 equal parts. But you cannot
know how, or that you even can, accomplish such a task, unless you
investigate, as Gauss did, the principle on which that act is
accomplished, in the complex domain.

During this time, Gauss was also investigating the "Kepler Problem", and
began to recognize what had blocked its solution. The general
characteristics of the problem can be illustrated pedagogically in the
following way:

The circular trigonometric transcendentals vary periodically according
to the angle a moving radius makes with a fixed diameter. (See [Figure
4](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure04.gif)
, [Animation
1](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49animation01.gif)
.) The circular sine has a period of 0 to 1 to 0 to -1 and the cosine
from 1 to 0 to -1 to 0, as the radius rotates around the circle. For
every one rotation, this cycle repeats. Thus, for example, the sine of
30 degrees, 390 degrees, 750 degrees are all the same.

However when this same relationship is extended to an ellipse, something
dramatically changes. In an ellipse the length of the radius changes as
it moves around the circle. (See [Figure
5](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure05.gif)

But how much it changes relative to the angle depends on the
eccentricity of the ellipse. (See [Figure

If the idea of the circular sine and cosine are extended to the ellipse,
then both the sine, cosine, and length of the radius each vary
periodically with the angle, but, how they vary depends on the
eccentricity of the ellipse. This, obviously, is a much more complicated
relationship than the circular functions. Whereas the circular functions
exhibit a very simple periodicity, the elliptical ones are much more
complicated. For this reason, the elliptical functions were generally
disregarded and all efforts to solve the "Kepler Problem" focused on
measuring elliptical action by circular functions, which proved very
elusive.

At Kaestner's prompting in the Spring of 1796, Gauss sought the more
general principle on which his method for dividing the circle depended,
by extending that investigation into the division of non-uniform curves.
While aiming for the elliptical functions, he set his first attack on
the simplest case of such a function: the lemniscate.

The lemniscate is a special case of an elliptical curve. It looks like a
figure 8 [(See Figure

It was originally investigated by Jacob Bernoulli, who was investigating
the physics of elastic rods. As such, it was originally known as the
"curva elastica" until Bernoulli gave it the Latin name, "lemniscate",
which means ribbon. The lemniscate is the locus of positions the product
of whose distances from two foci is always equal to the square of the
distance between the foci. [(See Figure
8)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure08.gif)
.

This property of the lemniscate has a similarity to the property of the
ellipse. In the ellipse the sum of the distance from the foci to the
curve is always a constant. [(See Figure
9.)](http://www.geocities.com/antidummy/part49figure09) For the
lemniscate it is the product of the distances. However, unlike the
ellipse which is an algebraic curve of the square power, the lemniscate
expresses the quartic power. (There is a simple geometric demonstration
of the above statement which would be a digression to develop here. The
reader is encouraged to discover it as a pedagogical exercise.)

The lemniscate has another geometrical property important for this
discussion. It can be formed by the inversion of a hyperbola in a
circle. [(See Figure
10.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure10.gif)

Gauss' investigation into the lemniscate began no later than August
1796, when he wrote out a series of eleven "Mathematical Exercises" on
various subjects. Of significance for this discussion is the fifth
exercise, in which Gauss begins to develop the characteristics of what
he would later call sinus lemniscatus, (lemniscate sine).

On January 8, 1797, Gauss wrote, " I have begun to investigate carefully
curves dependent upon the leminiscate integral ."

This followed on March 19, 1797, by an entry announcing that the
division of the lemniscate into "n" parts depends on "nn ^(t?-1)^ power,
accompanied by the additional notation: "Imaginary quantities: The
general criteria are sought according to which it is possible to
distinguish complex functions of many variables from the non-complex
ones." (the cited symbolic notation reads: n times n raised to the t
times square root of -1 power.)

Gauss' method of the division of the circle and his generalization to
the lemniscate and the elliptic functions, makes use of his clear
geometrical understanding of the complex exponential. Protests from
formalist sycophants not withstanding, Gauss' idea is completely
different than Euler's formal algebraic mish mash peddled in virtually
every text book today.

Gauss had this concept early on. On August 14, 1796, he wrote, "By the
way, (a + b?-1) ^(m\ +\ n?-1)^ , has been explained." And two days
later, he wrote, "The highest things are already of the mind. Let it
stand firm in order that they be protected." (Note: the cited notation
reads: a plus b times the square root of -1 raised to the m plus n to
the square root of -1 power.)

The Lemniscate and Elliptical Functions

We can get a preliminary taste for Gauss' discovery of the elliptical
transcendentals by investigating them using the geometrical methods
established by Gauss and developed more fully by Riemann. In this way we
will obviate, at least for now, the unnecessary use of formalism, which
otherwise might be required for a more complete investigation. This is a
method that both Gauss and Riemann emphasized, stating in numerous
locations, that while certain relationships can only be expressed
initially as formulae, the results can be given much better clarity
through geometrical representation. It must be born in mind, as Gauss
emphasized:

"The demonstration is presented using expressions borrowed from the
geometry of position, for in this way, the greatest acuity and
simplicity is obtained. Fundamentally, the essential content of the
entire argument belongs to a higher domain, independent from space, in
which abstract general concepts of magnitudes, are investigated as
combinations of magnitudes connected by continuity, a domain, which, at
present, is poorly developed, and in which one cannot move without the
use of language borrowed from spatial images."

Look at [figure
11](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure11.gif)
showing the lemniscate as the inversion of the hyperbola in the circle.
Now, let's investigate the principles that generate this relationship
among these three functions, through the method of complex mappings as
developed by Gauss in his work on curved surfaces and later extended by
Riemann.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

The mappings we will investigate all depend on the complex exponential
as Gauss indicated in his August, 14, 1796 notation. As was illustrated
in Riemann for Dummies 48, the complex exponential can be represented
geometrically as a stereographic projection. Under this mapping, the
arithmetic relationships of one surface are transformed into geometric
relationships on another. As, for example, the lines of latitude and
longitude on a sphere are transformed into exponentially spaced
concentric circles and radial lines on a plane. [(See Figure
12)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure12.gif)

When this same complex exponential is mapped from one plane to another,
it is expressed by the transformation of a grid of equally spaced lines
into the same exponentially spaced concentric circles and radial lines
of the stereographic projection. [(See Figure
13)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure13.gif)

Of particular importance for this discussion, is the periodicity of the
complex exponential. (See [Figure

From this standpoint, let's unfold the hidden relationships among the
hyperbola, circle and lemniscate. To do this, we adopt Gauss' method of
inversion. Instead of investigating the circular, hyperbolic and
lemniscatic functions as derived from the relevant curves, we
investigate how the curves are derived from the relevant functions.

Begin first with the circle. Think of the circle as that which is
produced by a right triangle whose hypotenuse is constant, but whose
angle varies. It is obvious that the circle is generated by two periodic
functions: the sine and the cosine.

Now turn to the hyperbola. The hyperbola is generated by a rectangle
whose sides change but whose area remains the same. [(See Figure
15)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure15.gif)
. This constant area determines two functions, the hyperbolic sine and
cosine. [(See Figure
16)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure16.gif)
. However, it is evident from the figure, that unlike the circle, the
hyperbolic sine and cosine are not periodic. The are always getting
bigger and bigger.

Now look at the lemniscate. Gauss defined two transcendental functions
for the lemniscate, called the lemniscatic sine and lemniscatic cosine
[(See Figure
17)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure17.gif)

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Something strange happens when we examine these functions. If we apply
Gauss' method of inversion, and derive the lemniscate from these
functions, we see that to define the entire lemniscate, the sine appears
to have two periods for each full rotation and the cosine appears to
have one. (See [Animation
5](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49animation05.gif)
).

Keep this curiosity in mind.

As developed in the previous installments on hyperbolic functions (See
Riemann for Anti-Dummies 33) the hyperbolic cosine is expressed
physically by the catenary, (See Figures
[18](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure18.gif)
and
[19](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure19.gif)
) and as such can be expressed by the exponential.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

When this principle is expressed as a Gauss- Riemann complex mapping,
the hyperbolic functions are formed from the midpoint of a line joining
two of the circles formed by the exponential, that are rotating in
opposite directions. (See [Animation
6](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49animation06.gif)
). From this standpoint, a periodicity emerges that otherwise had
remained hidden.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Now, look again at the circle. As Leibniz indicated, the circular
functions are also expressions of the complex exponential. (See Riemann
for Anti-Dummies Parts 37 and 38.) (See Figures
[20](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure20.gif)
and
[21](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure21.gif)
). When these functions are expressed as a Gauss-Riemann complex
mapping, the full expression of their periodicity is brought forth. They
too are formed by the countervailing rotations of the exponential
circles, but these circles are formed from the mappings that are at
right angles to the hyperbolic.

In sum, the circular and hyperbolic functions form the four possible
variations of the mappings of the complex exponential. This brings out a
unity between the hyperbola and circle that lies behind their visible
appearance as conic sections, but on which that visible appearance is
based.

In these examples we can see how the complex domain provides the means
to create a synthetic visualization of the interaction between the
visible domain and the unseen principles that lie behind it.

Now, look at the lemniscate. To unfold the lemniscate, Gauss applied the
same principle of inversion illustrated above for the circle and
hyperbola. A further elaboration of Gauss' discovery will be developed
in a future installment. But the characteristic of Gauss' discovery is
evident from the geometric characteristics that emerge when the
lemniscate functions are expressed in the complex domain.

What Gauss discovered was that the lemniscate functions, and more
generally, the elliptical functions are all doubly periodic. (See

). This is no where evident from the relationships that appear in the
visible domain. Furthermore, he demonstrated that the circular and
hyperbolic functions were special cases of the higher class of
elliptical transcendentals.

From this standpoint, Gauss established that the ellipse was governed by
a higher type of transcendental which subsumed the circular, hyperbolic
and exponential transcendentals. But these higher transcendentals were
only expressible in the complex domain. In other words, the principles
on which the planetary orbits really depended, were reflected by, but
not visible in, the domain of sense-perception, or its representation.
To passion to know these principles demanded the development of the
complex domain.

Ironically, Kepler's approach for calculating an approximate solution
for the "Kepler Problem", is essentially still the best approach for
determining the position of a planet in its orbit. But Gauss'
determination to investigate the paradox it revealed, led to his
discovery of those higher transcendentals on which the underlying
principles of planetary orbits are based. This paved the way for even
deeper investigations.

Riemann for Anti-Dummies Part 49

THE HIDDEN HISTORY OF THE COMPLEX DOMAIN

When Kepler discovered the elliptical nature of the planetary orbits, he
uncovered a paradox whose solution would require the development of an
entirely new way of thinking, and he called on future generations to
develop it. This "Kepler Problem", as it has since become known, was not
merely a mathematical lacuna, but reflected the ontological paradox
indicated by Nicholas of Cusa in "On Learned Ignorance" and other
locations. Kepler's demand provoked Leibniz to develop the infinitesimal
calculus, which revealed a new manifestation of that same paradox. This
led Leibniz to indicate that the solution existed in a higher, yet to be
discovered, domain of the imagination. Reflecting on these developments,
the young Carl F. Gauss discovered that what both Kepler and Leibniz had
sought. He called it the complex domain.

The above sketch is the true history of the origin of the discovery of
the complex domain. It was known to Gauss's immediate collaborators and
followers, but today it lies hidden, even to the relatively best
scientific thinkers. What has been substituted is the myth that complex
numbers arise as "impossible" solutions to formal algebraic equations a
myth whose malignancy has infected today's popular thinking far beyond
the domain of pure mathematics. The source of the myth is not new, but
begins with Venice's Paolo Sarpi's launching of modern empiricism, and
continues as a progression of degeneration through Hobbes, Descartes,
Newton, Euler, Kant, Lagrange, Hegel, Cauchy, Klein, and down into the
modern forms of existentialism and information theory associated with
Synarchism. Today, as always, its target is the intellectual and
emotional powers of mind associated with the development of the nation
state, as embodied in the hard won Declaration of Independence and
Constitution of the United States.

Consequently, anyone wishing to know the principles of science, must
understand the connection between the history of the development of the
complex domain, and the fight for the founding and preservation of the
United States. Conversely, anyone wishing to know the latter, must
understand its connection to the discovery of the complex domain.

For this reason, it is crucial that the record be set straight.

What follows is a summary overview. An opening statement, so to speak,
designed to lay out what the investigation will show. It is best worked
through slowly in small discussion groups. Over the coming installments
of this series, we will explore these matters more deeply. This will
take us, albeit not without a certain amount of hard work, directly to
Riemann's investigation of the higher transcendentals which he called
Abelian functions.

The "Kepler Problem"

The ultimate source of Kepler's discovery of the planetary orbits lies
not in some particular astronomical theorem, but, as Kepler repeatedly
emphasized, in his conception of Man. Unlike Ptolemy, Copernicus, and
Tycho Brahe, Kepler understood that Man was distinguished from lower
forms of life, by the capacity of mind that enabled him to rise above
the limitations of sense-perception and discover those unsensed
principles that govern the universe. As such, Kepler rejected the
Aristotelean methods of Ptolemy, Copernicus and Brahe, all of which
sought only to model the appearances of the motion of the heavenly
bodies. Instead, as Kepler emphasized, his approach was to derive the
apparent motion of the planets as a function of their physical causes.
Consequently, where Ptolemy, Copernicus, and Brahe looked only to the
domain of sense-perception, Kepler looked to the interaction between
what is perceived and the principles that efficiently control what is
perceived.

This latter point is crucial. Kepler did not ignore the world of
sense-perception. Rather, he understood that what appeared to the senses
was caused by principles that were unseen. But since those principles
could not be sensed directly, they could only be known through
contradictions and paradoxes that emerge in the domain of the senses.
From these paradoxes, the mind has the power to form a synthetic
visualization, so to speak, through which it can grasp for itself and
communicate to other minds, those unseen principles indicated through
the paradox. This synthetic visualization is emphatically not a
symbolism. Rather it is a metaphor that preserves the paradox so as to
guide the mind to the indicated principle that lies behind it.

It is in this light that the "Kepler Problem" must be seen. This problem
arises when trying to determine the non-uniform motion of a planet. Cusa
had already indicated that motion in the physical universe did not
conform, as Aristotle had insisted, to fixed perfect circles. Instead,
Cusa indicated that the perfection of the universe were better expressed
by the principle of change, and, as such, action in the physical
universe must be non-uniform, i.e., changing.

By deriving motion of the planets from physical causes, Kepler was led
to the discovery that Cusa was right. Kepler demonstrated that the
non-uniform motion of the planet through its orbit, as measured by the
speeding up or slowing down of the observed movement of the planet
against the background of stars on the inside of the celestial sphere,
was not just an appearance, as Ptolemy, Copernicus and Brahe all held,
but actually reflected the true physical motion of the planet. Thus, the
planet didn't just appear to be always changing, it {is} always
changing. Consequently, the planet's motion was being governed, not by a
fixed principle such as would be characterized by perfect circles, but
by a principle of change.

Kepler showed that that principle of change was embodied in the Sun,
which had the power to move the planets by an immaterial "species"
(idea), just as an idea in the mind moves the body. The measured
speeding up and slowing down of the planet indicated the existence of an
elliptical orbit in which the planet's distance to the Sun is always
increasing or decreasing. The always changing speed and direction of the
planet, thus reflects the principle of change inherent in the principle
of universal gravitation, as that principle was understood by Kepler,
not the dumbed down bastardization associated with Newton.

However, the elliptical orbit presented a new type of paradox. As Kepler
stated it, the relationship between the planet's position and the time
elapsed could be measured by his famous principle of equal areas. But
these areas were measured by the combination of a circular sector and a
rectilinear triangle. [(See Figure
1.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure01.gif)
Because of the "heterogeneity" of these two areas, this relationship
could only be determined retrospectively: that is, if one knew where the
planet had been, it was possible to measure the portion of the planet's
total period that had elapsed during that interval. However, Kepler
said, there was no elegant way to determine, prospectively, where the
planet would be, in a specified interval of time.

"But given the mean anomaly (time elapsed-bmd), there is no geometrical
method of proceeding to the equated, that is, eccentric anomaly
(position bmd). For the mean anomaly is composed of two areas, a sector
and a triangle. And while the former is numbered by the arc of the
eccentric, the latter is numbered by the sine of that arc multiplied by
the value of the maximum triangle, omitting the last digits And the
ratios between the arcs and their sines are infinite in number. So, when
we begin with the sum of the two, we cannot say how great the arc is,
and how great its sine, corresponding to this sum, unless we are
previously to investigate the area resulting from a given arc; that is,
unless you were to have constructed tables to have worked from them
subsequently.

"This is my opinion. Insofar as it is seen to lack geometrical beauty, I
exhort the geometers to solve me this problem:

Given the area of a part of a semicircle and a point on the diameter, to
find the arc and the angle at that point, the sides of which angle and
which arc, encloses the given area. Or, to cut the area of a semicircle
in a given ratio from any given point on the diameter.

It is enough for me to believe that I could not solve this a priori,
owing to the heterogeneity of the arc to the sine. Anyone who shows me
my error and points the way will be for me the great Apollonius."

Thus, having rejected Aristotle's perfect circles, Kepler had to measure
the planet's motion not merely by the arc of a circle, but by the
relationship of that arc to its sine. However, as Cusa had indicated,
the ratio of the sine to the arc is "infinite". Thus, the physical
motion of the planet depended on a quantity whose characteristics could
be precisely known, but could not be precisely calculated. The ellipse
was not the orbit, it was that which is lawfully produced by the
principle of universal gravitation.

Kepler did not directly observe this elliptical orbit, and to this day
neither has anyone else. Nevertheless, the elliptical orbit was known to
Kepler (and is known to anyone who relives his thoughts), more surely
than if it had been directly seen. However, there is something more to
the planet's orbit. The ellipse is only the visible manifestation of the
principle of universal gravitation, produced by the always changing
action of gravitation on the planet at every moment of its motion.

The question posed by the paradox of the "Kepler Problem" is: what is
the hidden characteristic of universal gravitation that produces the
elliptical shape of the orbit?

Since that characteristic cannot be seen, it must be discovered through
the paradox it presents in its visible expression. That paradox is the
indeterminacy expressed by the "Kepler Problem". The paradox does not
exist for the planet. The planet "knows" at all times what it is doing.
It moves seamlessly; always changing. The paradox exists in the
expression of that continuously changing orbit within the visible domain
of the elliptical orbit, through, as Kepler expresses it, the infinite
ratio of the sine to the arc.

**Leibniz' Infinitesimal Calculus**

What was required to solve this paradox was a new type of geometry that
could express the relationship between the seen and the unseen. That is
what Kepler demanded, and that is what Leibniz supplied.

Working from Fermat's method of inverse tangents and maximum and
minimum, Pascal's investigations of conic sections, and Huyghen's
development of involutes and evolutes, Leibniz invented the
infinitesimal calculus as a new type of geometry that expressed not only
what was seen, but the relationship of what is seen to the principles
that lay behind it. For reasons that will become clear below, Leibniz'
calculus, though inspired to solve the "Kepler Problem", didn't provide
its solution. Such a solution would require Gauss' discovery of the
complex domain.

The most direct means of grasping the principles of Leibniz' calculus is
through his, and Johann Bernoulli's application of the calculus to the
solution to the catenary problem. As has been developed more thoroughly
in other locations, the catenary expresses a principle of universal
least-action. That principle is what produces the unique shape of the
catenary, which, like the planetary orbit, acts on the hanging chain
differently at each point. But unlike the planetary orbit, the catenary
does not conform to a conic section.

To determine the shape of the catenary, Leibniz and Bernoulli first
investigated the physical manifestation of this continuously changing
least-action. This is most easily demonstrated pedagogically by the
often cited experiment showing the physical determination of the
catenary curve using a string and a hanging weight. (See Riemann for
Anti-Dummies 46.) As Bernoulli showed in his treatise on the integral
calculus, the total effect of the principle of least action is expressed
by the general shape of the catenary, while its continuously changing
manifestation at each (infinitesimal) point along the chain, is
expressed by the relationship between the sines of the angles formed by
the tangents. [(See Figure
2.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure01.gif)
In other words, the principle of least action exists outside the
catenary, but "touches" it at every point as if it were acting tangent
to the curve. Consequently, the continuously changing relationship of
these tangents produces a visible expression of the everywhere present,
but non-visible, principle of least action.

As this crucial example of the catenary illustrates, the infinitesimal
calculus is not the geometry of the domain of sense-perception. It is
the geometry of the interaction between the domain of sense-perception
and the principles that lie behind it. It is a generalization of
Kepler's method of measuring the planet's motion in any given interval,
by its relationship to the whole orbit. It is in that relationship, of
the whole (integral) to the part (differential) that expresses the
interaction of the unseen to the seen. That which is seen is produced by
the unseen acting according to a discoverable principle at each
infinitesimal interval.

As mentioned above, Bernoulli's application of the calculus to the
catenary problem demonstrated that, like the planetary orbit, the
physical principle governing the catenary was dependent on the sine of
the angle. But, Leibniz further demonstrated that the catenary curve was
also determined by another type of relationship that he called
logarithmic. [(See Figure
3.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure03.gif)

As has been developed more fully in earlier installments, this
logarithmic relationship is the generalization of the principle of
higher powers that was developed by the Pythagorean- Socratic current in
Classical Greece, as typified by the investigations into the doubling of
the line, square and cube. As Plato emphasizes, each type of action is
associated with a magnitude of a different power, which are each
mutually incommensurable. The more general form of these types of powers
is expressed by the logarithmic spiral and the exponential function.
Provoked by the type of discovery expressed by the catenary, Leibniz
investigated this more general form of these "Platonic" powers, and
discovered that they were related to a still higher power, expressed
through the form of the so-called "natural logarithm".

This type of discovery led Leibniz to distinguish between two types of
magnitudes transcendental and algebraic. The algebraic are those types
of magnitudes exemplified by the powers that double the line, square and
cube. The transcendental are those types of magnitudes exemplified by
the trigonometric and the exponential functions. As Cusa had insisted,
the transcendental powers are a higher type. All algebraic magnitudes
can be generated from transcendentals, but not the inverse.

As mentioned above, the planetary orbit, while dependent on a
transcendental function, i.e., the sine, is expressed by a conic
section, i.e., an ellipse. Apollonius had already demonstrated, as was
later expanded by Fermat and Pascal, that the conic sections expressed
the relationship of the second (square) algebraic power.

As such, Leibniz distinguished between those types of curves, such as
conic sections, that could be expressed algebraically, and those, like
the catenary, that could only be expressed by transcendental functions.

The catenary in particular, however, expressed a relationship between
the two types of transcendentals. On the one side, as Bernoulli showed,
it expressed the trigonometric, whereas on the other side, Leibniz
showed it expressed the exponential. Thus, the physical principle of
universal least-action indicated a connection between these two types of
transcendentals. Yet, mathematically these two types of transcendentals
appeared to be generated differently.

It is in the investigation of the connection between these two types of
transcendentals that Leibniz encountered the square root of minus 1. He
expressed this as the paradox of logarithms of negative numbers. (See
Riemann for Anti-Dummies Part 38.) He insisted that these logarithms
existed, but not in the visible domain, but in a domain still to be
imagined. As he discussed the matter in a letter to Huygens, "... there
is almost nothing more to be desired for the use which algebra can or
will be able to have in mechanics and in practice. It is believable that
this was the aim of the geometry of the ancients (at least that of
Apollonius) and the purpose of loci that he had introduced.... "

He was convinced that the square roots of negative numbers provided the
paradox that would open the door to this new domain where the
interaction between the seen and the unseen could be expressed. He
referred to them, as "amphibians somewhere between being and non-
being".

Gauss, The Kepler Problem, and The Complex Domain

It was left to the young Gauss, when he was between the ages of
seventeen and twenty, to discover that the higher transcendentals to
which Leibniz had pointed, demand the development of the complex domain
as that thought-object through which the interaction between the seen
and the unseen could be expressed. Herein would emerge the source of the
"Kepler Problem" that the motion of the planets in elliptical orbits are
governed not by the circular transcendentals, but by a higher form of
"elliptical" transcendental, the characteristics of which could only be
discovered and expressed in the complex domain.

Gauss never published his findings, except to indicate in a famous
remark in the "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae", that his method for the
division of the circle could also be applied to other transcendentals,
particularly the lemniscate. Gauss promised to publish these results in
a future time. But, due to the oppressive conditions brought on by the
rise of Napoleon and its aftermath, Gauss never brought forth the
promised text. His remark, however, prompted two brilliant youth, the
Norwegian, Niels Henrik Abel, and the German, C. G. Jacobi, (both of
whom were students of Gauss's collaborators, Hansteen and Dirichlet ,
respectively) to independently develop these results. Upon seeing their
work, Gauss remarked that he had already developed this theory when he
was a youth. At the time, these comments were dismissed as arrogant
boasting by those in the scientific community who were submitting to
fascist terror, as exemplified by the supreme bigot, Augustin Cauchy.

Nevertheless, Jacobi believed Gauss was right, writing in Crelle's
Journal in May 1839, that it was the investigation of elliptical
transcendentals which led Gauss to introduce complex numbers . Yet, it
wasn't until 1898, when Gauss' youthful diaries became available, that
the truthfulness of Gauss's statements was fully confirmed.

From a review of these diaries, it is clear that from the beginning,
Gauss was engaged in one unified investigation: the development of the
complex domain as that idea necessary to express those higher
transcendental relationships governing the physical universe.

While popular academia grudgingly admitts today that Gauss was the
actual discoverer of elliptical functions, they still falsely present
this discovery as an extension of the formal algebraic approach of Euler
and Lagrange. While Gauss' 1799 dissertation already exposes this as a
lie, the diaries give an even more complete picture of Gauss' train of
thought.

The diaries begin on March 30, 1796, with the announcement of the
discovery that the 17-gon is constructible by straight-edge and compass.
As has been developed in other locations (Riemann for Anti Dummies Parts
30 and 31 and JBT's lecture on the heptadecagon in L.A.) Gauss'
discovery depends on recognizing that the visible circle is an artifact
of a process that can only be expressed in the complex domain. From the
standpoint of the visible domain, it appears that the circle can only be
divided into 2, 3, or 5 parts by straight-edge and compass, as was
believed for more than two thousand years. Yet Gauss showed that the
principle on which the division of the circle depends, can only be
expressed in the complex domain. From this standpoint, the division of
the circle is seen as the more general form of the ancient Greek
problems of doubling the square and the cube.

The doubling of the square and cube are determined by those principles
that generate one or two means, respectively, between two extremes.
Gauss showed, that from the standpoint of the complex domain, the
division of the circle into "n" parts is the problem of finding the
principle that generates "n-1" means between two extremes. If "n-1" is 2
to a power of 2, then the problem can be transformed into a succession
of square roots, and is susceptible of being constructed by straight
edge and compass.

Work through Gauss' method for dividing the circle for yourself, using
the above cited pedagogicals as guide. For this discussion, bear in mind
this crucial point. An action that is carried out in the visible domain,
dividing a circle into "n" parts, is determined by a set of
relationships that cannot be expressed in the visible domain. Rather,
those relationships can only be expressed in the complex domain, where
the interaction between the visible and the principles that lie behind
it, can be made manifest.

Is the complex domain real? You can actually, with straight-edge and
compass, divide a visible circle into 17 equal parts. But you cannot
know how, or that you even can, accomplish such a task, unless you
investigate, as Gauss did, the principle on which that act is
accomplished, in the complex domain.

During this time, Gauss was also investigating the "Kepler Problem", and
began to recognize what had blocked its solution. The general
characteristics of the problem can be illustrated pedagogically in the
following way:

The circular trigonometric transcendentals vary periodically according
to the angle a moving radius makes with a fixed diameter. (See [Figure
4](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure04.gif)
, [Animation

.) The circular sine has a period of 0 to 1 to 0 to -1 and the cosine
from 1 to 0 to -1 to 0, as the radius rotates around the circle. For
every one rotation, this cycle repeats. Thus, for example, the sine of
30 degrees, 390 degrees, 750 degrees are all the same.

However when this same relationship is extended to an ellipse, something
dramatically changes. In an ellipse the length of the radius changes as
it moves around the circle. (See [Figure

But how much it changes relative to the angle depends on the
eccentricity of the ellipse. (See [Figure

If the idea of the circular sine and cosine are extended to the ellipse,
then both the sine, cosine, and length of the radius each vary
periodically with the angle, but, how they vary depends on the
eccentricity of the ellipse. This, obviously, is a much more complicated
relationship than the circular functions. Whereas the circular functions
exhibit a very simple periodicity, the elliptical ones are much more
complicated. For this reason, the elliptical functions were generally
disregarded and all efforts to solve the "Kepler Problem" focused on
measuring elliptical action by circular functions, which proved very
elusive.

At Kaestner's prompting in the Spring of 1796, Gauss sought the more
general principle on which his method for dividing the circle depended,
by extending that investigation into the division of non-uniform curves.
While aiming for the elliptical functions, he set his first attack on
the simplest case of such a function: the lemniscate.

The lemniscate is a special case of an elliptical curve. It looks like a
figure 8 [(See Figure
7)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure07.gif)

It was originally investigated by Jacob Bernoulli, who was investigating
the physics of elastic rods. As such, it was originally known as the
"curva elastica" until Bernoulli gave it the Latin name, "lemniscate",
which means ribbon. The lemniscate is the locus of positions the product
of whose distances from two foci is always equal to the square of the
distance between the foci. [(See Figure
8)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure08.gif)
.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

This property of the lemniscate has a similarity to the property of the
ellipse. In the ellipse the sum of the distance from the foci to the
curve is always a constant. [(See Figure
9.)](http://www.geocities.com/antidummy/part49figure09) For the
lemniscate it is the product of the distances. However, unlike the
ellipse which is an algebraic curve of the square power, the lemniscate
expresses the quartic power. (There is a simple geometric demonstration
of the above statement which would be a digression to develop here. The
reader is encouraged to discover it as a pedagogical exercise.)

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

The lemniscate has another geometrical property important for this
discussion. It can be formed by the inversion of a hyperbola in a
circle. [(See Figure
10.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure10.gif)

Gauss' investigation into the lemniscate began no later than August
1796, when he wrote out a series of eleven "Mathematical Exercises" on
various subjects. Of significance for this discussion is the fifth
exercise, in which Gauss begins to develop the characteristics of what
he would later call sinus lemniscatus, (lemniscate sine).

On January 8, 1797, Gauss wrote, " I have begun to investigate carefully
curves dependent upon the leminiscate integral ."

This followed on March 19, 1797, by an entry announcing that the
division of the lemniscate into "n" parts depends on "nn ^(t?-1)^ power,
accompanied by the additional notation: "Imaginary quantities: The
general criteria are sought according to which it is possible to
distinguish complex functions of many variables from the non-complex
ones." (the cited symbolic notation reads: n times n raised to the t
times square root of -1 power.)

Gauss' method of the division of the circle and his generalization to
the lemniscate and the elliptic functions, makes use of his clear
geometrical understanding of the complex exponential. Protests from
formalist sycophants not withstanding, Gauss' idea is completely
different than Euler's formal algebraic mish mash peddled in virtually
every text book today.

Gauss had this concept early on. On August 14, 1796, he wrote, "By the
way, (a + b?-1) ^(m\ +\ n?-1)^ , has been explained." And two days
later, he wrote, "The highest things are already of the mind. Let it
stand firm in order that they be protected." (Note: the cited notation
reads: a plus b times the square root of -1 raised to the m plus n to
the square root of -1 power.)

The Lemniscate and Elliptical Functions

We can get a preliminary taste for Gauss' discovery of the elliptical
transcendentals by investigating them using the geometrical methods
established by Gauss and developed more fully by Riemann. In this way we
will obviate, at least for now, the unnecessary use of formalism, which
otherwise might be required for a more complete investigation. This is a
method that both Gauss and Riemann emphasized, stating in numerous
locations, that while certain relationships can only be expressed
initially as formulae, the results can be given much better clarity
through geometrical representation. It must be born in mind, as Gauss
emphasized:

"The demonstration is presented using expressions borrowed from the
geometry of position, for in this way, the greatest acuity and
simplicity is obtained. Fundamentally, the essential content of the
entire argument belongs to a higher domain, independent from space, in
which abstract general concepts of magnitudes, are investigated as
combinations of magnitudes connected by continuity, a domain, which, at
present, is poorly developed, and in which one cannot move without the
use of language borrowed from spatial images."

Look at [figure
11](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure11.gif)
showing the lemniscate as the inversion of the hyperbola in the circle.
Now, let's investigate the principles that generate this relationship
among these three functions, through the method of complex mappings as
developed by Gauss in his work on curved surfaces and later extended by
Riemann.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

The mappings we will investigate all depend on the complex exponential
as Gauss indicated in his August, 14, 1796 notation. As was illustrated
in Riemann for Dummies 48, the complex exponential can be represented
geometrically as a stereographic projection. Under this mapping, the
arithmetic relationships of one surface are transformed into geometric
relationships on another. As, for example, the lines of latitude and
longitude on a sphere are transformed into exponentially spaced
concentric circles and radial lines on a plane. [(See Figure
12)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure12.gif)

When this same complex exponential is mapped from one plane to another,
it is expressed by the transformation of a grid of equally spaced lines
into the same exponentially spaced concentric circles and radial lines
of the stereographic projection. [(See Figure
13)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure13.gif)

Of particular importance for this discussion, is the periodicity of the
complex exponential. (See [Figure

From this standpoint, let's unfold the hidden relationships among the
hyperbola, circle and lemniscate. To do this, we adopt Gauss' method of
inversion. Instead of investigating the circular, hyperbolic and
lemniscatic functions as derived from the relevant curves, we
investigate how the curves are derived from the relevant functions.

Begin first with the circle. Think of the circle as that which is
produced by a right triangle whose hypotenuse is constant, but whose
angle varies. It is obvious that the circle is generated by two periodic
functions: the sine and the cosine.

Now turn to the hyperbola. The hyperbola is generated by a rectangle
whose sides change but whose area remains the same. [(See Figure
15)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure15.gif)
. This constant area determines two functions, the hyperbolic sine and
cosine. [(See Figure
16)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure16.gif)
. However, it is evident from the figure, that unlike the circle, the
hyperbolic sine and cosine are not periodic. The are always getting
bigger and bigger.

Now look at the lemniscate. Gauss defined two transcendental functions
for the lemniscate, called the lemniscatic sine and lemniscatic cosine
[(See Figure
17)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure17.gif)

Something strange happens when we examine these functions. If we apply
Gauss' method of inversion, and derive the lemniscate from these
functions, we see that to define the entire lemniscate, the sine appears
to have two periods for each full rotation and the cosine appears to
have one. (See [Animation
5](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49animation05.gif)

Keep this curiosity in mind.

As developed in the previous installments on hyperbolic functions (See
Riemann for Anti-Dummies 33) the hyperbolic cosine is expressed
physically by the catenary, (See Figures
[18](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure18.gif)
and
[19](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure19.gif)
) and as such can be expressed by the exponential.

When this principle is expressed as a Gauss- Riemann complex mapping,
the hyperbolic functions are formed from the midpoint of a line joining
two of the circles formed by the exponential, that are rotating in
opposite directions. (See [Animation
6](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49animation06.gif)
). From this standpoint, a periodicity emerges that otherwise had
remained hidden.

Now, look again at the circle. As Leibniz indicated, the circular
functions are also expressions of the complex exponential. (See Riemann
for Anti-Dummies Parts 37 and 38.) (See Figures
[20](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure20.gif)
and
[21](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure21.gif)
). When these functions are expressed as a Gauss-Riemann complex
mapping, the full expression of their periodicity is brought forth. They
too are formed by the countervailing rotations of the exponential
circles, but these circles are formed from the mappings that are at
right angles to the hyperbolic.

In sum, the circular and hyperbolic functions form the four possible
variations of the mappings of the complex exponential. This brings out a
unity between the hyperbola and circle that lies behind their visible
appearance as conic sections, but on which that visible appearance is
based.

In these examples we can see how the complex domain provides the means
to create a synthetic visualization of the interaction between the
visible domain and the unseen principles that lie behind it.

Now, look at the lemniscate. To unfold the lemniscate, Gauss applied the
same principle of inversion illustrated above for the circle and
hyperbola. A further elaboration of Gauss' discovery will be developed
in a future installment. But the characteristic of Gauss' discovery is
evident from the geometric characteristics that emerge when the
lemniscate functions are expressed in the complex domain.

What Gauss discovered was that the lemniscate functions, and more
generally, the elliptical functions are all doubly periodic. (See
Figures
[22](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure22.gif)
,
[23](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure23.gif)
, and
[24](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part49_files_part49figure24.gif)
). This is no where evident from the relationships that appear in the
visible domain. Furthermore, he demonstrated that the circular and
hyperbolic functions were special cases of the higher class of
elliptical transcendentals.

From this standpoint, Gauss established that the ellipse was governed by
a higher type of transcendental which subsumed the circular, hyperbolic
and exponential transcendentals. But these higher transcendentals were
only expressible in the complex domain. In other words, the principles
on which the planetary orbits really depended, were reflected by, but
not visible in, the domain of sense-perception, or its representation.
To passion to know these principles demanded the development of the
complex domain.

Ironically, Kepler's approach for calculating an approximate solution
for the "Kepler Problem", is essentially still the best approach for
determining the position of a planet in its orbit. But Gauss'
determination to investigate the paradox it revealed, led to his
discovery of those higher transcendentals on which the underlying
principles of planetary orbits are based. This paved the way for even
deeper investigations.
