DIE WIDMUNG

The following pedagogy is dedicated to the celebration of Lyn and
Helga's silver wedding anniversary on Dec. 29, which is an occasion for
joy, not only for said happy couple, but for all people around the world
to whom this marriage has contributed such happiness over the past
quarter-century.

**The Long Life of the Catenary: From Brunelleschi to LaRouche**

The shift from a consumer society to a producer one is, fundamentally, a
question of understanding power. For consumers, the world is a universe
of magical powers, from which the apparent requirements of life are
obtained through the intercession of high priests. Such people, when
confronted with a turn of events, such as the present, in which the
powers on which they've relied no longer deliver, become frightened.
They demand action from their increasingly impotent priesthood, who,
despite all boasts to the contrary, fail to produce results. They then
take matters into their own hands, adopting ever increasing desperate
rituals designed to appeal directly to the powers on which their hopes
are pinned. The high priests, seeking to restore "consumer confidence"
and regain their positions of lofty authority, suggest to the frightened
populace, that new rituals be performed and new incantations be recited.
Each desperate effort fails to bring about any respite from the crisis.
Suspicions mount that the unseen potencies have either gone deaf or
departed the scene. Dead or deaf, the thought that such powers might
never have existed is their ultimate terror. Even if these forces are
now believed gone, the idea of their previous existence not only
persists, but continues to govern the thoughts and actions of the
populari, feeding the hopeless pessimism that leads such unfortunate
creatures into a contorted dance reminiscent of those depicted in a
Breugel masterpiece.

There was a similar state of affairs in 14th century Florence, when in
the aftermath of the Black Death in which nearly 80% of the Florentine
population perished, a group of artists succeeded in launching the
project to build a Dome with a diameter of 42 meters over the church of
Santa Maria del Fiore. [(See Figure

When the decision to undertake that project was made in 1367, the man
who would ultimately execute it, Filippo Brunelleshci, was not even
born, but the intention that would guide him was already embedded in the
proposed size of the structure, and the requirements of its design. The
Dome was to be equal in size to the Roman Pantheon, that temple to the
mystical powers on whose behalf Roman popular opinion ruled. [(See

From the time of its construction in 128 A.D. under Emperor Hadrian, the
Pantheon had remained the largest domed structure in the world. But,
unlike the Pantheon, the Florentine Dome was to be beautiful from both
the inside and out. It was to be a complete break with the pantheonic
culture that, even though the Emperors had long since ceased to rule
directly under its name, had continued to persist for more than 13
centuries and had brought about the very recent calamity from which
Europe was still reeling.

The Dome was a project of bold optimism. It would not only span such a
large structure, but by being self-supporting and free standing, it
would demonstrate a principle that would transform the entire
surrounding region, and through the minds of travelers and the
imaginations of those with whom they would speak, the entire world.

The full implications of the principles necessary to construct the Dome
were not known to the Dome's original designers, but, to accomplish the
feat, Brunelleschi would have to discover, apply, and communicate a form
of the universal principle of least-action whose further elaboration
would unfold over the ensuing 500 years. The crucial development
occurred in 1988, when Lyndon LaRouche, faced with imminent unjust
imprisonment, visited the Dome and recognized the implications of
Brunelleschi's discoveries for the subsequent breakthroughs of Leibniz,
Gauss and Riemann, and for the future, development of a new physical
science.(See 1989 issue of 21st Century with Dome on the cover.)

**The Dome and Anti-Euclidean Geometry**

Imagine yourself in 1420 looking at the octagonal drum of Santa Maria
del Fiore without the Dome. What do you see? Empty space? If so, you
would never envision, let alone build, the Dome. The construction of the
Dome required a mastery of principles not visible to the eye. Not the
invisible mystical powers of the Pantheon, but the universal physical
principles, which, though unseen, are known clearly through the
imagination. For the scientist, like the artist, there is no empty
space, no empty canvass, no blank slate. There is a manifold of physical
principles characterized by a set of relationships whose expression
takes the ultimate form of the work of art. To visualize the unbuilt
Dome, as the artist Brunelleschi would, imagine the physical principles,
and the bricks and mortar take the required form.

This is the basis on which to begin to construct a physical geometry
from the standpoint of Brunelleschi, Leibniz, Gauss, Riemann and
LaRouche.

To grasp this, think of the difference between abstract geometrical
shapes, and the physical geometry of bricks and mortar.

Start with a vertical column. An abstract geometrical line, according to
Euclid, is that extension in empty space which has only length. No
matter how long the line, its width, is always the same, namely, nil.
However, when building a vertical column (line) of bricks, the higher
the column, the greater the pressure on the lower bricks. To build the
column higher requires strengthening the lower portions of the column,
by increasing its width, or by some other means.

Extend this thought to an area. From the standpoint of empty Euclidean
space, an area is that which has length and width. A bounded area is
enclosed by a line either straight or curved. A physical area, however,
is enclosed by a physical structure, the shape of which is determined by
physical principles. One approach to enclosing a physical area, would be
to build two vertical columns and span those columns with a flat roof.
But, this is a relatively weak structure, as the roof is only strong
near where it is supported by the columns. The farther apart the columns
are, the weaker is the roof. [(See Figure
3.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part41_files_part41figure03.gif)

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Figure 3**                                                          |
|                                                                       |

| .wp-image-387 width="281" height="500"}                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

A far more stable structure for vaulting a vertical area is an arch. The
circle is at first thought the simplest type of arch, because the
circular boundary encloses the largest area by the least perimeter. If
the arch is designed so that all the bricks point to the center of the
circle, the arch will be relatively stable upon completion. [(See Figure
4.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part41_files_part41figure04.gif)
But, while under construction, the arch cannot support itself, requiring
the use of a temporary scaffolding to support the arch under
construction. Thus, the arch is self-supporting as a whole, but not in
its parts.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Figure 4**                                                          |
|                                                                       |

| .wp-image-389 width="500" height="312"}                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

The circular arch poses another problem. Even though it encloses the
greatest area with the least perimeter, its height is a function of its
width and the line of pressure does not conform to the circular curve.
[(See Figure
5.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part41_files_part41figure05.gif)

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Figure 5**                                                          |
|                                                                       |

| .wp-image-391 width="500" height="291"}                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

To enclose a taller area requires a wider arch which in turn decreases
the overall stability of the structure because the downward pressure
from the upper bricks pushes the sides of the arch outward. Thus, even
though, from the standpoint of abstract geometry, the circle is
isoperimetric, from the standpoint of physical geometry, some other
shape provides the greatest stability for the tallest area. The shape
that achieves this is a pointed arch in which the two arcs that make up
the arch are circular arcs with different centers. [(See Figure
6.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part41_files_part41figure06.gif)
The pointed arch, thus, not only encloses a taller area, but is more
stable because the curvature of the arch conforms more closely to the
physical line of stresses in the structure. In other words, the shape of
the arch is determined not by abstract geometrical characteristics but
by physical ones.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Figure 6**                                                          |

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Now, to the problem facing Brunelleschi enclosing a volume.
Geometrically, a volume is enclosed by a surface, which is produced when
a curve is moved. For example, from the famous construction of Archytas,
when a circle is moved along a line, a cylinder is produced; when
rotated around a point, a torus is produced; and when rotated around a
line, a sphere is produced. And so, a dome can be produced by rotating
an arch, either circular or pointed around an axis. [(See Figure
7.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part41_files_part41figure07.gif)

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Figure 7**                                                          |
|                                                                       |

| .wp-image-395 width="800" height="368"}                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

But, a physical surface, such as a dome, is not simply a rotated arch,
because a new set of stresses occurs in the dome that does not occur in
the arch. In addition to the stresses along the arch, (from top to
bottom, i.e., longitudinal), there are stresses around the dome
(circumferential or hoop).

So, the problem Brunelleschi faced in building the Dome of the required
size was to design a structure whose shape would balance these stresses
without requiring external buttressing which would diminish the Dome's
beauty and undermine its effectiveness for changing society by changing
the minds of the population.

Additionally, a dome, like an arch, generally requires a supporting
scaffold, or centering, to hold it up until its completion. Here,
Brunelleschi faced his most formidable obstacle. The Dome over Santa
Maria del Fiore was so big that there was not enough wood available to
build such a large scaffolding. Consequently, Brunelleschi took the bold
step of building the Dome without centering, requiring him to construct
a dome that was self-supporting in its whole and its parts. Such a shape
could not be determined by the methods associated with Euclidean
geometry. The shape Brunelleschi required was determined only by
physical principles.

To do this, Brunelleschi decided to construct two domes, one inside the
other, with a stairway between them. Both would conform to the pointed
arch form called for in the original design. However, according to the
architect Bartoli, (see 1989 21st Century) the curve of the inner dome
was a based on a circle whose diameter was three fourths the inside
diameter of the octagonal drum (pointed fourth) while the outer dome's
curvature was four-fifths the outer diameter (a pointed fifth) [(See
Figure
8.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part41_files_part41figure08.gif)

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Since the use of centering had to be avoided, Brunelleschi had to
control the curvature of both domes very carefully as the were being
constructed. This entailed controlling three different curvatures: the
longitudinal curvature; the circumferential curvature; and the curvature
inward towards the center of the Dome. If all three curvatures could be
controlled during all phases of construction, the Dome would not only be
stable upon completion, but each stage would be stable enough to be a
platform from which the next stage would be built. Thus, the Dome had to
conform to a shape that would be self-supporting in its whole and its
parts.

Brunelleschi had to solve a multitude of problems, each requiring
revolutionary new ideas to accomplish the task. But, the discovery most
central to his success, the one most relevant for the future development
of the anti-Euclidean physical geometry of Kepler, Fermat, Leibniz,
Gauss and Riemann, is the one identified by LaRouche. Brunelleschi used
a hanging chain to guide the development of the curvature of the dome at
each stage of construction. Thus, the overall shape of the Dome was
determined, not by a curvature defined by abstract mathematics, but by a
physically defined principle. Just as a hanging chain is self-supporting
in its whole and its parts, the Dome, whose curvature is guided by the
curvature of the hanging chain, is, likewise, self-supporting surface,
in its whole and its parts.

The beauty of the Dome demonstrates the truth of Brunelleschi's
discovery, but, it would take the discoveries of Kepler, Fermat,
Leibniz, Gauss, Riemann and LaRouche to fully grasp the underlying
principle.

**The Development of the Physical Idea of Shape**

The success of Brunelleschi's Dome demonstrated that the architectural
principles of physical geometry on which it was based were universal.
This view was expressed by Johannes Kepler, who approximately 150 years
later wrote concerning the construction of the solar system in his
Mysterium Cosmographicum, "We perceive how God, like one of our own
architects, approached the task of constructing the universe with order
and pattern, and laid out the individual parts accordingly, as if it
were not art which imitated Nature, but God himself had looked to the
mode of building of Man who was to be."

Kepler went on to develop, in that work and in his subsequent New
Astronomy and Harmonies of the World, that the shape of the solar
system, like the Dome, was determined not by considerations of abstract
mathematics, (which would have indicated perfectly circular orbits) but
by physically determined harmonic principles. Thus, the elliptical
planetary orbits, like Brunelleschi's Dome, were the size and shape that
they had to be in order to express the harmonic relationships of those
physical principles.

This physically determined idea of shape took another step in its
development with Fermat's determination that the shape of the pathway of
light was determined by the principle of shortest-time:

"Our demonstration is based on the single postulate, that Nature
operates by the most easy and convenient methods and pathways --- as it
is in this way that we think the postulate should be stated, and not, as
usually is done, by saying that Nature always operates by the shortest
lines ... We do not look for the shortest spaces or lines, but rather
those that can be traversed in the easiest way, most conveniently and in
the shortest time."

Leibniz, following up on the discoveries of Kepler and Fermat,
generalized these discoveries as a universal principle of least-action:

"...the Architect of all things created light in such a way that this
most beautiful result is born from its very nature. That is the reason
why those who, like Descartes, reject the existence of Final Causes in
Physics, commit a very big mistake, to say the least; because aside from
revealing the wonders of divine wisdom, such final causes make us
discover a very beautiful principle, along with the properties of such
things whose intimate nature is not yet that clearly perceived by us,
that we can have the power to explain them, and make use of their
efficient causes, along with their artifacts, such as the Creator
employed them in order to produce their results, and to determine their
ends. It must be further understood from this that the meditations of
the ancients on such matters are not to be taken lightly, as certain
people think nowadays."

Leibniz' most far reaching discovery of this principle of least-action,
made in collaboration with Johann Bernoulli, demonstrated that the
catenary, the guiding principle of Brunelleschi's Dome, embodied the
most universal expression of least-action. As we've developed in other
locations, the physical characteristic by which the hanging chain
supports itself, expresses all the elementary transcendental
relationships of geometry: the circular, hyperbolic, and the powers
associated with lines, surfaces and volumes. [(See Figure

Look back at our earlier comparison of the difference between abstract
geometrical notions of line, area and volume, with the physical
requirements of constructing a column, arch and dome. As is already
implicit in the concept of powers developed by Pythagoras, Archytas,
Plato, et al., even the purely geometrical concepts of line, area and
volume are ultimately determined by the physical principles which
Leibniz demonstrated are expressed by the catenary. The idea of lines,
areas and volumes, separated from this idea of power as universal
physical principles, is as chimerical as the mystical powers of the
Roman Pantheon.

**From Pathways to Surfaces**

Brunelleschi's Dome points the way to a still further development of the
universal principle of least-action. Planetary orbits, the curvature of
light, and catenaries are all pathways, i.e. curves. Brunelleschi's Dome
is a least-action surface.

The concepts to understand this distinction were developed by Gauss who,
looking back as we've been doing, on the discoveries of Kepler, Fermat
and Leibniz, developed the foundations of a physical theory of surfaces.

The context for Gauss' discovery was his measurement of the surface of
the Earth, which, because it is physically determined, must, in keeping
with Leibniz' principle, be a least-action surface. Over a more than 20
year period, Gauss made careful astronomical and geodetical measurements
of the Earth. Abstract geometrical considerations would suggest that the
Earth would be a perfect sphere, because the sphere enclosed the largest
volume inside the smallest surface. But, because the Earth is a rotating
body in the solar system, its physical shape is not spherical, but
ellipsoidal.

As we have developed in earlier pedagogicals, Gauss' measurements led
him to discover that the physical shape of the Earth was not
ellipsoidal, but something more irregular. He identified the,
"geometrical shape of the Earth, as that shape which is everywhere
perpendicular to the pull of gravity." In other words, Gauss did not try
to fit the Earth into a shape pulled from the text books of abstract
mathematics, rather, he invented a new geometry that conformed to the
physical characteristics of the rotating Earth.

Gauss reported the generalization of his discoveries in his 1822
Copenhagen Prize Essay, on conformal representation and his 1827,
"General Investigations of Curved Surfaces". Future pedagogicals will
develop these concepts in greater detail, while here we focus on the
general ideas most relevant to this discussion.

For Gauss, all surfaces had a characteristic curvature, which in turn
determined certain least-action pathways, that he later called,
"geodesics". For example, in a plane, the geodesic is a straight-line,
while on a sphere, the geodesic is a great circle. In these two cases
the curvature is uniform and so the geodesic is the same every where on
the surface. In contrast, an ellipsoid, for example, is a surface of
non-uniform curvature. Consequently, the geodesic is different depending
on its direction and position on the surface. [(See Figure
10.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part41_files_part41figure10.gif)

To illustrate this, the reader is encouraged to do some physical
experiments. Take a plane, sphere, spaghetti squash or other irregular
shaped object. Mark two points at different places on the surface and
stretch a thread between them so that the thread is taught. The thread
will conform approximately to the geodesic between those two points.
Notice that on the plane, the geodesic is always a straight line, while
on the sphere it is always a great circle, while on the squash, the
geodesic changes from place to place, and direction to direction.

There is a further distinction between the plane and the sphere or
ellipsoid. On the plane there are an infinite number of pathways between
any two points, but only one of these paths is a geodesic, i.e.
least-action. This is also true on a sphere or ellipsoid, except, if the
two points are at the poles. Then there are an infinite number of
geodesics between these two points. Thus, the bounded nature of the
sphere and ellipsoid, produce a singularity with respect to the nature
of the geodesics. The significance of this distinction will become more
clear as we develop more of Riemann's geometry in future pedagogicals.

What Gauss investigated was the general principles by which the
curvature of the surface determined the characteristic of the geodesic.
Of immediate relevance for this discussion is Gauss' determination of a
means to measure the curvature of the surface at any point. It is
sufficient for our purposes here to illustrate this by a physical
demonstration. On the squash, draw a circle by tying a marker to one end
of the thread and rotating it while holding the other end of the thread
in a fixed position. The radii of this circle are all geodesics in
different directions. Now examine the curvature of each geodesic, which
will vary for each direction. However, one geodesic will be the least
curved, while another will be the most curved. Now, try this on a
different type of surface, such as a butternut squash shaped like a
dumbbell. The part of the round ends of the butternut squash have the
same characteristic as the spaghetti squash, in that the center of
curvature is always inside the squash. But, in the middle of the squash
something different happens. Here the center of curvature is either
inside or outside the squash, depending on the direction of the
geodesic. This characteristic Gauss called, "negative curvature" and is
the characteristic of curvature expressed by a surface formed by a
rotated catenary called a catenoid. [(See Figure
11.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part41_files_part41figure11.gif)

Brunelleschi's Dome expresses this characteristic of negative curvature.

Furthermore, Gauss proved that on any surface, no matter how irregularly
it was curved, the geodesics of maximum and minimum curvature would
always be at right angles to each other!

Thus, at any place on a surface, the curvature of the surface expresses
a physical principle that in turn determines the geodesic, or
least-action pathway within that surface.

**From Surfaces to Manifolds**

Working from Gauss' discovery, Riemann generalized this concept still
further to the idea of a geodesic within a manifold of universal
physical principles. The manifolds cannot be directly visualized but the
characteristics of that manifold can be directly determined by a change
in geodesic.

For example, light under reflection and refraction follows a pathway
within a surface, but each type of action expresses a different pathway
because the physical manifold of refraction includes a principle,
changing speed of light, that does not exist within the manifold of
reflection. The addition of this new principle to the manifold of
action, changes the geodesic.

Riemann developed the means to represent these higher manifolds by
complex functions. For example, as was developed in the previous
pedagogical, the conic section orbits and catenary are both least-action
pathways with respect to the manifold of universal gravitation. In other
words, each represents a changing geodesic with the manifold of
universal gravitation. But, when the catenary is expressed as a function
in the Gauss/Riemann complex domain, the conic section orbits are seen
as a subsumed geodesic within the higher principle represented by the
catenary. (See Riemann for Anti-Dummies Part 40.)

More general examples are illustrated in the accompanying animations.
[](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part41_files/part41figure12) These
illustrate how the same action, when carried out in different manifolds,
is changed by the characteristics of the manifold. Think of the
orthogonal nets in each figure as the minimum and maximum geodesics in
each manifold. The loopy curve maintains the same angular orientation
with respect to these geodesics in each case. But, because the geodesics
change, from manifold to manifold, the action changes. Thus, a change in
the principles that determine the manifold, change the geodesics, which
in turn change all action within that manifold. Conversely, to effect a
physical change in any action, one must act to change the
characteristics of the manifold.

Now look at Brunelleschi's Dome from this standpoint. The Dome is a
surface whose geodesic, in principle, conforms to the catenary. As a
least-action surface, it expresses a geodesic with respect to the
principle of universal gravitation. With respect to the manifold of
universal history, building the Dome was the geodesic from that dying
culture of the Roman Empire to the Renaissance.

At our present place in the manifold of universal history, building
LaRouche's youth movement combat university on wheels and making
LaRouche President of the United States, is for us, Brunelleschi's
Dome-- the geodesic from this dark age to our Renaissance.

DIE WIDMUNG

The following pedagogy is dedicated to the celebration of Lyn and
Helga's silver wedding anniversary on Dec. 29, which is an occasion for
joy, not only for said happy couple, but for all people around the world
to whom this marriage has contributed such happiness over the past
quarter-century.

**The Long Life of the Catenary: From Brunelleschi to LaRouche**

The shift from a consumer society to a producer one is, fundamentally, a
question of understanding power. For consumers, the world is a universe
of magical powers, from which the apparent requirements of life are
obtained through the intercession of high priests. Such people, when
confronted with a turn of events, such as the present, in which the
powers on which they've relied no longer deliver, become frightened.
They demand action from their increasingly impotent priesthood, who,
despite all boasts to the contrary, fail to produce results. They then
take matters into their own hands, adopting ever increasing desperate
rituals designed to appeal directly to the powers on which their hopes
are pinned. The high priests, seeking to restore "consumer confidence"
and regain their positions of lofty authority, suggest to the frightened
populace, that new rituals be performed and new incantations be recited.
Each desperate effort fails to bring about any respite from the crisis.
Suspicions mount that the unseen potencies have either gone deaf or
departed the scene. Dead or deaf, the thought that such powers might
never have existed is their ultimate terror. Even if these forces are
now believed gone, the idea of their previous existence not only
persists, but continues to govern the thoughts and actions of the
populari, feeding the hopeless pessimism that leads such unfortunate
creatures into a contorted dance reminiscent of those depicted in a
Breugel masterpiece.

There was a similar state of affairs in 14th century Florence, when in
the aftermath of the Black Death in which nearly 80% of the Florentine
population perished, a group of artists succeeded in launching the
project to build a Dome with a diameter of 42 meters over the church of
Santa Maria del Fiore. [(See Figure
1.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part41_files_part41figure01.jpg)

When the decision to undertake that project was made in 1367, the man
who would ultimately execute it, Filippo Brunelleshci, was not even
born, but the intention that would guide him was already embedded in the
proposed size of the structure, and the requirements of its design. The
Dome was to be equal in size to the Roman Pantheon, that temple to the
mystical powers on whose behalf Roman popular opinion ruled. [(See

From the time of its construction in 128 A.D. under Emperor Hadrian, the
Pantheon had remained the largest domed structure in the world. But,
unlike the Pantheon, the Florentine Dome was to be beautiful from both
the inside and out. It was to be a complete break with the pantheonic
culture that, even though the Emperors had long since ceased to rule
directly under its name, had continued to persist for more than 13
centuries and had brought about the very recent calamity from which
Europe was still reeling.

The Dome was a project of bold optimism. It would not only span such a
large structure, but by being self-supporting and free standing, it
would demonstrate a principle that would transform the entire
surrounding region, and through the minds of travelers and the
imaginations of those with whom they would speak, the entire world.

The full implications of the principles necessary to construct the Dome
were not known to the Dome's original designers, but, to accomplish the
feat, Brunelleschi would have to discover, apply, and communicate a form
of the universal principle of least-action whose further elaboration
would unfold over the ensuing 500 years. The crucial development
occurred in 1988, when Lyndon LaRouche, faced with imminent unjust
imprisonment, visited the Dome and recognized the implications of
Brunelleschi's discoveries for the subsequent breakthroughs of Leibniz,
Gauss and Riemann, and for the future, development of a new physical
science.(See 1989 issue of 21st Century with Dome on the cover.)

**The Dome and Anti-Euclidean Geometry**

Imagine yourself in 1420 looking at the octagonal drum of Santa Maria
del Fiore without the Dome. What do you see? Empty space? If so, you
would never envision, let alone build, the Dome. The construction of the
Dome required a mastery of principles not visible to the eye. Not the
invisible mystical powers of the Pantheon, but the universal physical
principles, which, though unseen, are known clearly through the
imagination. For the scientist, like the artist, there is no empty
space, no empty canvass, no blank slate. There is a manifold of physical
principles characterized by a set of relationships whose expression
takes the ultimate form of the work of art. To visualize the unbuilt
Dome, as the artist Brunelleschi would, imagine the physical principles,
and the bricks and mortar take the required form.

This is the basis on which to begin to construct a physical geometry
from the standpoint of Brunelleschi, Leibniz, Gauss, Riemann and
LaRouche.

To grasp this, think of the difference between abstract geometrical
shapes, and the physical geometry of bricks and mortar.

Start with a vertical column. An abstract geometrical line, according to
Euclid, is that extension in empty space which has only length. No
matter how long the line, its width, is always the same, namely, nil.
However, when building a vertical column (line) of bricks, the higher
the column, the greater the pressure on the lower bricks. To build the
column higher requires strengthening the lower portions of the column,
by increasing its width, or by some other means.

Extend this thought to an area. From the standpoint of empty Euclidean
space, an area is that which has length and width. A bounded area is
enclosed by a line either straight or curved. A physical area, however,
is enclosed by a physical structure, the shape of which is determined by
physical principles. One approach to enclosing a physical area, would be
to build two vertical columns and span those columns with a flat roof.
But, this is a relatively weak structure, as the roof is only strong
near where it is supported by the columns. The farther apart the columns
are, the weaker is the roof. [(See Figure

A far more stable structure for vaulting a vertical area is an arch. The
circle is at first thought the simplest type of arch, because the
circular boundary encloses the largest area by the least perimeter. If
the arch is designed so that all the bricks point to the center of the
circle, the arch will be relatively stable upon completion. [(See Figure
4.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part41_files_part41figure04.gif)
But, while under construction, the arch cannot support itself, requiring
the use of a temporary scaffolding to support the arch under
construction. Thus, the arch is self-supporting as a whole, but not in
its parts.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Figure 4**                                                          |

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

The circular arch poses another problem. Even though it encloses the
greatest area with the least perimeter, its height is a function of its
width and the line of pressure does not conform to the circular curve.
[(See Figure
5.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part41_files_part41figure05.gif)

To enclose a taller area requires a wider arch which in turn decreases
the overall stability of the structure because the downward pressure
from the upper bricks pushes the sides of the arch outward. Thus, even
though, from the standpoint of abstract geometry, the circle is
isoperimetric, from the standpoint of physical geometry, some other
shape provides the greatest stability for the tallest area. The shape
that achieves this is a pointed arch in which the two arcs that make up
the arch are circular arcs with different centers. [(See Figure
6.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part41_files_part41figure06.gif)
The pointed arch, thus, not only encloses a taller area, but is more
stable because the curvature of the arch conforms more closely to the
physical line of stresses in the structure. In other words, the shape of
the arch is determined not by abstract geometrical characteristics but
by physical ones.

Now, to the problem facing Brunelleschi enclosing a volume.
Geometrically, a volume is enclosed by a surface, which is produced when
a curve is moved. For example, from the famous construction of Archytas,
when a circle is moved along a line, a cylinder is produced; when
rotated around a point, a torus is produced; and when rotated around a
line, a sphere is produced. And so, a dome can be produced by rotating
an arch, either circular or pointed around an axis. [(See Figure
7.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part41_files_part41figure07.gif)

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

But, a physical surface, such as a dome, is not simply a rotated arch,
because a new set of stresses occurs in the dome that does not occur in
the arch. In addition to the stresses along the arch, (from top to
bottom, i.e., longitudinal), there are stresses around the dome
(circumferential or hoop).

So, the problem Brunelleschi faced in building the Dome of the required
size was to design a structure whose shape would balance these stresses
without requiring external buttressing which would diminish the Dome's
beauty and undermine its effectiveness for changing society by changing
the minds of the population.

Additionally, a dome, like an arch, generally requires a supporting
scaffold, or centering, to hold it up until its completion. Here,
Brunelleschi faced his most formidable obstacle. The Dome over Santa
Maria del Fiore was so big that there was not enough wood available to
build such a large scaffolding. Consequently, Brunelleschi took the bold
step of building the Dome without centering, requiring him to construct
a dome that was self-supporting in its whole and its parts. Such a shape
could not be determined by the methods associated with Euclidean
geometry. The shape Brunelleschi required was determined only by
physical principles.

To do this, Brunelleschi decided to construct two domes, one inside the
other, with a stairway between them. Both would conform to the pointed
arch form called for in the original design. However, according to the
architect Bartoli, (see 1989 21st Century) the curve of the inner dome
was a based on a circle whose diameter was three fourths the inside
diameter of the octagonal drum (pointed fourth) while the outer dome's
curvature was four-fifths the outer diameter (a pointed fifth) [(See
Figure
8.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part41_files_part41figure08.gif)

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Since the use of centering had to be avoided, Brunelleschi had to
control the curvature of both domes very carefully as the were being
constructed. This entailed controlling three different curvatures: the
longitudinal curvature; the circumferential curvature; and the curvature
inward towards the center of the Dome. If all three curvatures could be
controlled during all phases of construction, the Dome would not only be
stable upon completion, but each stage would be stable enough to be a
platform from which the next stage would be built. Thus, the Dome had to
conform to a shape that would be self-supporting in its whole and its
parts.

Brunelleschi had to solve a multitude of problems, each requiring
revolutionary new ideas to accomplish the task. But, the discovery most
central to his success, the one most relevant for the future development
of the anti-Euclidean physical geometry of Kepler, Fermat, Leibniz,
Gauss and Riemann, is the one identified by LaRouche. Brunelleschi used
a hanging chain to guide the development of the curvature of the dome at
each stage of construction. Thus, the overall shape of the Dome was
determined, not by a curvature defined by abstract mathematics, but by a
physically defined principle. Just as a hanging chain is self-supporting
in its whole and its parts, the Dome, whose curvature is guided by the
curvature of the hanging chain, is, likewise, self-supporting surface,
in its whole and its parts.

The beauty of the Dome demonstrates the truth of Brunelleschi's
discovery, but, it would take the discoveries of Kepler, Fermat,
Leibniz, Gauss, Riemann and LaRouche to fully grasp the underlying
principle.

**The Development of the Physical Idea of Shape**

The success of Brunelleschi's Dome demonstrated that the architectural
principles of physical geometry on which it was based were universal.
This view was expressed by Johannes Kepler, who approximately 150 years
later wrote concerning the construction of the solar system in his
Mysterium Cosmographicum, "We perceive how God, like one of our own
architects, approached the task of constructing the universe with order
and pattern, and laid out the individual parts accordingly, as if it
were not art which imitated Nature, but God himself had looked to the
mode of building of Man who was to be."

Kepler went on to develop, in that work and in his subsequent New
Astronomy and Harmonies of the World, that the shape of the solar
system, like the Dome, was determined not by considerations of abstract
mathematics, (which would have indicated perfectly circular orbits) but
by physically determined harmonic principles. Thus, the elliptical
planetary orbits, like Brunelleschi's Dome, were the size and shape that
they had to be in order to express the harmonic relationships of those
physical principles.

This physically determined idea of shape took another step in its
development with Fermat's determination that the shape of the pathway of
light was determined by the principle of shortest-time:

"Our demonstration is based on the single postulate, that Nature
operates by the most easy and convenient methods and pathways --- as it
is in this way that we think the postulate should be stated, and not, as
usually is done, by saying that Nature always operates by the shortest
lines ... We do not look for the shortest spaces or lines, but rather
those that can be traversed in the easiest way, most conveniently and in
the shortest time."

Leibniz, following up on the discoveries of Kepler and Fermat,
generalized these discoveries as a universal principle of least-action:

"...the Architect of all things created light in such a way that this
most beautiful result is born from its very nature. That is the reason
why those who, like Descartes, reject the existence of Final Causes in
Physics, commit a very big mistake, to say the least; because aside from
revealing the wonders of divine wisdom, such final causes make us
discover a very beautiful principle, along with the properties of such
things whose intimate nature is not yet that clearly perceived by us,
that we can have the power to explain them, and make use of their
efficient causes, along with their artifacts, such as the Creator
employed them in order to produce their results, and to determine their
ends. It must be further understood from this that the meditations of
the ancients on such matters are not to be taken lightly, as certain
people think nowadays."

Leibniz' most far reaching discovery of this principle of least-action,
made in collaboration with Johann Bernoulli, demonstrated that the
catenary, the guiding principle of Brunelleschi's Dome, embodied the
most universal expression of least-action. As we've developed in other
locations, the physical characteristic by which the hanging chain
supports itself, expresses all the elementary transcendental
relationships of geometry: the circular, hyperbolic, and the powers
associated with lines, surfaces and volumes. [(See Figure
9.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part41_files_part41figure09.gif)

Look back at our earlier comparison of the difference between abstract
geometrical notions of line, area and volume, with the physical
requirements of constructing a column, arch and dome. As is already
implicit in the concept of powers developed by Pythagoras, Archytas,
Plato, et al., even the purely geometrical concepts of line, area and
volume are ultimately determined by the physical principles which
Leibniz demonstrated are expressed by the catenary. The idea of lines,
areas and volumes, separated from this idea of power as universal
physical principles, is as chimerical as the mystical powers of the
Roman Pantheon.

**From Pathways to Surfaces**

Brunelleschi's Dome points the way to a still further development of the
universal principle of least-action. Planetary orbits, the curvature of
light, and catenaries are all pathways, i.e. curves. Brunelleschi's Dome
is a least-action surface.

The concepts to understand this distinction were developed by Gauss who,
looking back as we've been doing, on the discoveries of Kepler, Fermat
and Leibniz, developed the foundations of a physical theory of surfaces.

The context for Gauss' discovery was his measurement of the surface of
the Earth, which, because it is physically determined, must, in keeping
with Leibniz' principle, be a least-action surface. Over a more than 20
year period, Gauss made careful astronomical and geodetical measurements
of the Earth. Abstract geometrical considerations would suggest that the
Earth would be a perfect sphere, because the sphere enclosed the largest
volume inside the smallest surface. But, because the Earth is a rotating
body in the solar system, its physical shape is not spherical, but
ellipsoidal.

As we have developed in earlier pedagogicals, Gauss' measurements led
him to discover that the physical shape of the Earth was not
ellipsoidal, but something more irregular. He identified the,
"geometrical shape of the Earth, as that shape which is everywhere
perpendicular to the pull of gravity." In other words, Gauss did not try
to fit the Earth into a shape pulled from the text books of abstract
mathematics, rather, he invented a new geometry that conformed to the
physical characteristics of the rotating Earth.

Gauss reported the generalization of his discoveries in his 1822
Copenhagen Prize Essay, on conformal representation and his 1827,
"General Investigations of Curved Surfaces". Future pedagogicals will
develop these concepts in greater detail, while here we focus on the
general ideas most relevant to this discussion.

For Gauss, all surfaces had a characteristic curvature, which in turn
determined certain least-action pathways, that he later called,
"geodesics". For example, in a plane, the geodesic is a straight-line,
while on a sphere, the geodesic is a great circle. In these two cases
the curvature is uniform and so the geodesic is the same every where on
the surface. In contrast, an ellipsoid, for example, is a surface of
non-uniform curvature. Consequently, the geodesic is different depending
on its direction and position on the surface. [(See Figure
10.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part41_files_part41figure10.gif)

To illustrate this, the reader is encouraged to do some physical
experiments. Take a plane, sphere, spaghetti squash or other irregular
shaped object. Mark two points at different places on the surface and
stretch a thread between them so that the thread is taught. The thread
will conform approximately to the geodesic between those two points.
Notice that on the plane, the geodesic is always a straight line, while
on the sphere it is always a great circle, while on the squash, the
geodesic changes from place to place, and direction to direction.

There is a further distinction between the plane and the sphere or
ellipsoid. On the plane there are an infinite number of pathways between
any two points, but only one of these paths is a geodesic, i.e.
least-action. This is also true on a sphere or ellipsoid, except, if the
two points are at the poles. Then there are an infinite number of
geodesics between these two points. Thus, the bounded nature of the
sphere and ellipsoid, produce a singularity with respect to the nature
of the geodesics. The significance of this distinction will become more
clear as we develop more of Riemann's geometry in future pedagogicals.

What Gauss investigated was the general principles by which the
curvature of the surface determined the characteristic of the geodesic.
Of immediate relevance for this discussion is Gauss' determination of a
means to measure the curvature of the surface at any point. It is
sufficient for our purposes here to illustrate this by a physical
demonstration. On the squash, draw a circle by tying a marker to one end
of the thread and rotating it while holding the other end of the thread
in a fixed position. The radii of this circle are all geodesics in
different directions. Now examine the curvature of each geodesic, which
will vary for each direction. However, one geodesic will be the least
curved, while another will be the most curved. Now, try this on a
different type of surface, such as a butternut squash shaped like a
dumbbell. The part of the round ends of the butternut squash have the
same characteristic as the spaghetti squash, in that the center of
curvature is always inside the squash. But, in the middle of the squash
something different happens. Here the center of curvature is either
inside or outside the squash, depending on the direction of the
geodesic. This characteristic Gauss called, "negative curvature" and is
the characteristic of curvature expressed by a surface formed by a
rotated catenary called a catenoid. [(See Figure
11.)](http://archive.canadianpatriot.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2010/02/wlym.com_antidummies_part41_files_part41figure11.gif)

Brunelleschi's Dome expresses this characteristic of negative curvature.

Furthermore, Gauss proved that on any surface, no matter how irregularly
it was curved, the geodesics of maximum and minimum curvature would
always be at right angles to each other!

Thus, at any place on a surface, the curvature of the surface expresses
a physical principle that in turn determines the geodesic, or
least-action pathway within that surface.

**From Surfaces to Manifolds**

Working from Gauss' discovery, Riemann generalized this concept still
further to the idea of a geodesic within a manifold of universal
physical principles. The manifolds cannot be directly visualized but the
characteristics of that manifold can be directly determined by a change
in geodesic.

For example, light under reflection and refraction follows a pathway
within a surface, but each type of action expresses a different pathway
because the physical manifold of refraction includes a principle,
changing speed of light, that does not exist within the manifold of
reflection. The addition of this new principle to the manifold of
action, changes the geodesic.

Riemann developed the means to represent these higher manifolds by
complex functions. For example, as was developed in the previous
pedagogical, the conic section orbits and catenary are both least-action
pathways with respect to the manifold of universal gravitation. In other
words, each represents a changing geodesic with the manifold of
universal gravitation. But, when the catenary is expressed as a function
in the Gauss/Riemann complex domain, the conic section orbits are seen
as a subsumed geodesic within the higher principle represented by the
catenary. (See Riemann for Anti-Dummies Part 40.)

More general examples are illustrated in the accompanying animations.
[](http://wlym.com/antidummies/part41_files/part41figure12) These
illustrate how the same action, when carried out in different manifolds,
is changed by the characteristics of the manifold. Think of the
orthogonal nets in each figure as the minimum and maximum geodesics in
each manifold. The loopy curve maintains the same angular orientation
with respect to these geodesics in each case. But, because the geodesics
change, from manifold to manifold, the action changes. Thus, a change in
the principles that determine the manifold, change the geodesics, which
in turn change all action within that manifold. Conversely, to effect a
physical change in any action, one must act to change the
characteristics of the manifold.

Now look at Brunelleschi's Dome from this standpoint. The Dome is a
surface whose geodesic, in principle, conforms to the catenary. As a
least-action surface, it expresses a geodesic with respect to the
principle of universal gravitation. With respect to the manifold of
universal history, building the Dome was the geodesic from that dying
culture of the Roman Empire to the Renaissance.

At our present place in the manifold of universal history, building
LaRouche's youth movement combat university on wheels and making
LaRouche President of the United States, is for us, Brunelleschi's
Dome-- the geodesic from this dark age to our Renaissance.
